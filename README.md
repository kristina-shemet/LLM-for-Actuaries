# Using Large Language Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Actuarial Science

## Overview
This repository features all the materials from my master thesis, which focused on enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the actuarial science field using advanced machine learning techniques. The project specifically explores the post-training effects on the Mistral 7B model utilizing a Swiss regulatory document concerning tied assets for insurance companies. Through the application of fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, the study aimed to improve the model's ability to process and interpret complex document content. Although fine-tuning showed minimal improvement in the model's response precision, the incorporation of RAG significantly increased the accuracy and relevance of the responses. This outcome illustrates that LLMs, when augmented with RAG, can effectively comprehend and contextualize beyond their initial training sets, thereby offering more precise and timely solutions to actuarial queries.

## Usage
To replicate the fine-tuning and testing process, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have a Python environment with Jupyter installed, or prefer to use Google Colab for an environment that requires no setup.
2. [Open the `LLM_for_Actuarial_Science.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RzcQa_4XjopqqJLa-PDXV18bJhQEpFC8?usp=sharing).
3. Before running the notebook, ensure to switch to a GPU runtime:
   - From the menu in Colab, go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`.
   - Choose `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to install any required libraries and run the cells.
