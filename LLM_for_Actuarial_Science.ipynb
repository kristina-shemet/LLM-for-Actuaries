              "\"For an interest rate derivative to be included in the tied assets with a value of zero, several specific conditions outlined in the provided text must be met. These conditions are integral to ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining the integrity of the tied assets. Here is a detailed breakdown of these conditions:\\n\\n1. **Hedged Market Value Relative to Cost Amortization Value**: The text specifies that if the hedged market value is higher than (or equal to) the value determined by the cost amortization method, the interest rate derivative can be included in the tied assets at a zero value. This condition helps ensure that the inclusion of the derivative does not artificially inflate the value of the tied assets.\\n\\n2. **Compliance with Articles**: The inclusion at a zero value is contingent upon compliance with Art. 79 para. 1 let. i and Art. 88 para. 1 SO. These articles likely reference specific regulatory standards that must be adhered to, ensuring that the derivative's inclusion is in line with legal requirements.\\n\\n3. **Impairment Event**: If, at the conclusion of the hedging transaction, the hedged market value is below the imputed value as per the cost amortization method, an impairment event is triggered by acquiring the hedging instrument. This scenario leads to adjustments and considerations regarding the value of the bond and the derivative.\\n\\n4. **Adjustment Options in the Event of Impairment**: The text outlines two options in the event of an impairment:\\n   - The imputed value of the bond can be adjusted downward to match the hedged market value, and this new initial value is then written down or up to the redemption value over the remaining term, with the derivative credited at a zero value.\\n   - Derivative transactions can be settled via free assets, implying alternative handling outside tied assets.\\n\\n5. **Conditions for Macro Hedges**: When dealing with macro hedges, certain challenges and conditions are noted:\\n   - The hedged assets are included in the tied assets, and the obligations are always covered by the underlying assets in tied assets.\\n   - Effective hedging of underlying assets must be ensured through the chosen hedging instrument.\\n   - The insurance company should designate the portfolio of insured bonds in the internal inventory.\\n   - The derivative is recognized with a zero value.\\n   - The insurance company must perform a test upon concluding the derivative transaction to ensure no shortfall in the target amount of tied assets. This test involves comparing the sum of the hedged market values with the sum of all imputed values at AMC for bonds affected by the macro hedge. If the result is negative, a permanent surplus in the tied assets must be maintained at least in the amount of this difference until the hedge is terminated.\\n   - Results of this test, with updated values, must be disclosed in the annual report on tied assets to FINMA.\\n\\nThese detailed conditions establish a framework for the prudent inclusion of interest rate derivatives in tied assets, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while managing and acknowledging the risks associated with hedging transactions and market fluctuations.\""

In particular, this is intended to \\navoid the previously separate safeguarding of the savings and guarantee components.89\\nThis Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined \\nlimits, the coverage obligations and the qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be \\ntaken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization \\ntransactions (insurance classes A2.1-A2.6 as well as A6.1 and A6.2), however, exceptions \\napply with regard to the limits (see margin no. 122).90\\nb) Foreign insurance portfolio\\nThe insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied \\nassets if equivalent security must be provided abroad (Art. 17 para. 2 ISA). If no equivalent \\nsecurity has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the \\nprovision can be made in separate tied assets (Art. 77 para. 2 let. b SO).91\\nIf there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in \\nSwitzerland.92\\nThe following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: 93\\n\\u2022Special assets 94\\n\\n### Section: Page 14\\n14/70There is an obligation to cover the entire technical provisions from direct insurance \\nthrough a special fund. The gross technical provisions must be covered (without taking \\ninto account claims against reinsurers). If an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured \\nportions of the provisions (see margin nos. 160-175) exists for insurance companies that \\noperate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. It must be ensured \\nthat only those contracts participate in the special fund that are fully included in the target \\namount.\\nInstead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into \\naccount, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the \\ninsurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets.95\\nFor these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. 96\\n\\u2022Bankruptcy privilege\\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the special assets are primarily available to satisfy claims arising \\nfrom insurance contracts.97\\n\\u2022Investment guidelines\\nThe local supervisory authority specifies investment guidelines aimed at maintaining the \\nsecurity and value of the investment fund.98\\nc) Unit-linked life insurance policies\\nUnit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions must be linked to permissible \\nassets for the tied assets: In the case of unit-linked contracts, these are open-ended collective \\ninvestment schemes that fall under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA; SR 951.31) \\n(Art. 125a SO). In the case of contracts linked to internal investment portfolios or other \\nreference values, these are permissible values in accordance with Art. 79 SO and Art. 81 \\npara. 2 SO.99\\nThe investments used as collateral must correspond to those on which the contracts are \\nbased (matching cover; Art. 81 AVO), as otherwise the insurance company bears an \\nadditional investment risk. Any guarantees must be secured with investments in accordance \\nwith Art. 79 AVO that replicate the fluctuations in value of these guarantees as well as \\npossible. Other contractual components, non-unit-linked provisions and any supplement to the \\ntarget amount must be secured with values in accordance with Art. 79 AVO.100\\nIn accordance with Art. 93a AVO, investments to secure claims from unit-linked life insurance \\npolicies are valued at no more than market value, irrespective of\\nthe other capitalized values in accordance with Chapter IV.101\\n\\n### Section: Page 15\\n15/70d) Indirect investments: Initial acquisition, restructuring\\nAn investment - whether as an initial acquisition or through restructuring - in so-called indirect \\ninvestments (e.g. in funds, participations, structured products or bonds issued by special \\npurpose vehicles [SPVs]) may not be used to circumvent the provisions on direct investments \\nin accordance with Chapter IV.102\\nThis circular deals with the following indirect investments:\\n\\u2022collective investment schemes in accordance with margin nos. 484-493;\\n\\u2022Single investor funds according to margin nos. 494-505;\\n\\u2022Real estate companies in accordance with margin no. 256 (for a participation of more than \\n50%) or margin no. 240 (as a listed real estate company);\\n\\u2022structured products and securitized receivables in accordance with margin nos. 197 and \\n214;\\n\\u2022alternative investments in accordance with margin nos. 317-350.103\\nDepending on the instrument, specific qualitative requirements and a high level of liquidity are \\ndemanded for the entire investment instrument or a so-called look-through approach is \\napplied. An investment in an indirect investment that contains a non-eligible direct investment \\nis only permitted if the specific provisions for the indirect investment are met and its \\ncharacteristics mean that the disadvantages that lead to the non-eligibility of the direct \\ninvestment do not affect the indirect investment.104\\nExample: An investment in real estate that is relatively illiquid and difficult to value and is \\ntherefore not a permissible investment in tied assets cannot be counted as a permissible \\ninvestment even if it is restructured as an indirect investment. It can only be included if the risk \\nsituation for the investor actually improves, as illustrated by the following list based on an \\ninvestment in real estate.105\\n106Structure Creditable?

This waiver must also be expressly declared as binding in the event of the \\ninsolvency of the insurance company.523\\ncc) Securing the reimbursement claim with collateral\\n\\u2022To secure uncovered claims arising from securities lending, collateral must be delivered to \\na separate custody account or account. The collateral is set up in the name of the \\ninsurance company. The collateral should be transferred at the same time as the \\nsecurities are delivered.524\\n\\u2022The custodian (custodian bank) for the collateral must comply with the guidelines for the \\nsafekeeping of assets (margin nos. 154-159) and have signed the corresponding model \\nagreement.525\\n\\u2022The value of the collateral must be appropriate and amount to at least 105% of the market \\nvalue of the securities lent at all times. If bonds with a credit rating of 3 (or better) are lent \\nand the collateral is provided in the same currency as cash or bonds with a credit rating of \\n1, the value of the collateral must be at least 102% of the market value of the securities \\nlent.526\\n\\u2022The collateral must comply with the investment regulations for direct investments in tied \\nassets. The collateral must be capable of being valued and traded on a daily basis and \\ncorrespond to credit quality step 3 or better and must not have been issued by the \\ncounterparty or relate to it.527\\n\\u2022Collateral received may not be repledged, lent, sold or used in the context of derivative \\ntransactions, securities lending or repurchase agreements.\\nCash collateral can be reinvested in highly liquid, short-term money market investments \\nand highly liquid bonds with a (residual) term of up to a maximum of twelve months. Due \\nto the fact that the cash collateral can be recalled from the borrower at any time, the \\ninsurance company must have sufficient liquidity. Strategies and guidelines for the \\nreinvestment of cash collateral are part of the insurance company's investment policy and \\nrisk management (including stress tests under various tighter market conditions) and are \\ndocumented, periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.528\\n\\u2022It must be ensured that the insurance company has full and unconditional access to the \\ncollateral if the counterparty does not return the borrowed securities, does not return them \\non time or only partially returns them. Any third-party claims against the insurance \\ncompany must not affect access to the collateral.\\ntainers. This must also apply in the event of insolvency.529\\n\\n### Section: Page 63\\n63/70e) Limitations\\nSecurities lending and repo transactions are cumulatively limited to 30% of the debit amount \\nf r o m  a gross perspective.530\\nBorrowed underlying assets must be taken into account when complying with the limits in \\naccordance with margin nos. 108-122.531\\nf) Valuation, crediting and listing\\nIn order to secure the reclaims from securities lending, the receivables and liabilities (taking \\ninto account accrued interest) as well as the income accruing to the insurance company must \\nbe valued daily at the current market price (mark-to-market) and the difference must be settled \\ndaily.532\\nThe underlying assets lent out remain allocated to tied assets. They are recognized at a \\nmaximum of the current market value or at a maximum of the recognition value at the time of \\nlending, if this is lower.533\\nThe collateral received is allocated to the tied assets and must be identified as such. The \\ncollateral may not be taken into account when calculating the cover of the tied assets, as the \\nsecurities lent are taken into account.534\\nUnderlying assets that have been lent are marked \\\"lent\\\" in the list of tied assets.

Repurchase agreements\\na) Definition\\nA repo (repurchase agreement) is a legal transaction in which one party (lender) transfers \\nownership of securities to another party (borrower) in return for payment and in which the \\nborrower undertakes to return securities of the same type, quantity and quality to the lender \\non maturity, as well as the income accruing during the term of the repurchase agreement. As \\nthe repurchase amount is determined in advance, the lender bears the price risk of the \\nsecurities during the term of the repurchase agreement.538\\nReverse repo (reverse repurchase agreement): Repo from the perspective of the lender. 539\\nRepo interest: Difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the securities. 540\\nWhile legal ownership of the securities in a repo transaction is transferred to the lender or \\nborrower (legal owner), the lender or borrower remains the beneficial owner. Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due in the course of the repo transaction are due to the lender. If \\ncontractually agreed, the seller may repurchase the securities sold prematurely, whereby the \\nrespective value date/delivery deadlines must be taken into account for the delivery of the \\nsecurities. As a beneficial owner, the pension provider bears the risks of fluctuations in the \\nsecurities and takes these into account when adding the securities to the tied assets.541\\nb) Purpose\\nThe repo transaction serves the purpose of obtaining short-term liquidity. Reverse repo is a \\nshort-term collateralized investment of surplus liquidity.542\\nc) Permitted transactions\\nRepurchase agreements are permitted under the following conditions: 543\\n\\u2022Framework agreement\\nThe insurance undertaking concludes the necessary framework agreements with the \\ncounterparty to the repurchase agreement (margin nos. 552-557).544\\n\\u2022Repo trading platform and settlement system\\nRepo transactions must be executed on an established repo trading platform that meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\n\\u2022central administration of the multilateral treaty system;\\n\\u2022simultaneous processing of the transaction;545\\n\\n### Section: Page 65\\n65/70\\u2022mapping of processes in real time;\\n\\u2022daily valuation (mark-to-market, at least once a day) of all open repo positions and\",\n          \"10/70acquisition of new business or business growth) sufficient assets are available to cover the \\ntarget amount of the tied assets.\\ne) Order\\nThe insurance company establishes the tied assets by allocating assets. It records and \\nidentifies these assets in such a way that it can prove at any time without delay which assets \\nbelong to the tied assets and that the target amount of each tied asset is covered (Art. 76 \\npara. 1 AVO).47\\nf) Criteria for the allocation of assets to restricted assets\\nAn asset can be allocated to restricted assets if: 48\\n\\u2022the investment is an admissible value in accordance with Art. 79 or Art. 68 para. 2 SO and \\nis eligible in accordance with this Circular. Partial crediting of investments (e.g. due to \\nnon-creditable parts or increased risks) is not permitted. Partial offsetting of the \\ninvestment is only possible if the exception is explicitly described in this circular (e.g. \\nmortgages, margin no. 312);49\\n\\u2022the investment can generally be valued without any problems; 50\\n\\u2022the investment has a high level of liquidity in relation to the corresponding investment \\ncategory;51\\n\\u2022the necessary expertise is available and appropriate processes and systems are applied \\nthat are necessary for the professional selection, management and control of the \\ninvestment made (margin no. 76);52\\n\\u2022The effects of the investment and its individual risk components are understood so that \\nthe financial, legal and operational risks can be assessed at all times;53\\n\\u2022the debtor's creditworthiness is verifiable (margin no. 139-152); 54\\n\\u2022the asset is neither encumbered nor can it be offset against third-party claims (margin no. 38). 55\\nThese principles are specified for each investment category in Chapters IV and V. 56\\nC. Investment strategy\\nThe Executive Board determines the investment strategy and submits it to the Board of Directors \\nfor approval (Art. 78 para. 1 let. a, Art. 101 SO).57\\nThe investment strategy takes appropriate account of the type and complexity of the business \\nconducted, in particular the insurance business (Art. 102 para. 1 SO).58\\n\\n### Section: Page 11\\n11/70The framework conditions for the use of the various investment categories must be defined in \\nthe investment strategy. All investments must be anchored in the investment strategy of the \\ncompany as a whole.59\\nThe limits of risk exposure must be set in accordance with the financial and organizational \\ncapacities of the insurance company.60\\nD. Investment regulations\\nThe investment regulations are issued by the Executive Board or a member of the Executive \\nBoard or the general representative and define the entire investment activity (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. b, Art. 106 para. 1 SO). The investment activity is comprehensively described in a \\ndocument, whereby specific references to other internal directives are possible.61\\nThe requirements for the investment regulations are based on the complexity of the investments \\nin the investment universe defined by the insurance company.62\\nThe insurance company regulates at least the following topics in the investment regulations: 63\\n\\u2022Internal investment principles and objectives (incl. ALM); 64\\n\\u2022Description of the investment universe (permitted investments / restrictions); 65\\n\\u2022Investment techniques and their area of application/purpose (e.g. use of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, securities lending, repurchase agreements);66\\n\\u2022Description of the investment process, monitoring and controls (definition of tasks, \\nresponsibilities, competencies, accountability and escalation mechanisms);67\\n\\u2022Staff requirements (e.g. specialist knowledge, experience, integrity). 68\\nE. Organization and control\\nThe administration (investment management) and control (risk management) of the \\ninvestment activity must be carried out by persons who are independent of each other and \\nmust be organizationally appropriate to the complexity of the business and investment activity \\n(Art. 78, 106 SO).69\\nThe staff must have adequate qualifications and knowledge of the asset classes invested in \\nand, in the case of investments in riskier investments, appropriate expertise (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. c, Art. 107 SO).70\\nThe systems used should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the investment portfolio, \\nbe monitored and have the necessary stability (Art. 106 para. 2 SO).71\\n\\n### Section: Page 12\\n12/70The administration (investment management) must ensure and perform at least the following \\ntasks:72\\n\\u2022the implementation of the investment strategy and the investment regulations; 73\\n\\u2022the definition and documentation of the strategic and tactical asset allocation, which is \\nadapted to the risk capacity, size and complexity of the insurance company, whereby the \\nallocation is made in relation to asset classes and other important characteristics such as \\nduration, sectors, creditworthiness and investment styles;74\\n\\u2022setting a limit system based on individual risk capacity, monitoring limits and defining \\nmeasures in the event of limit breaches;75\\n\\u2022the provision of an investment process that is commensurate with the complexity of the \\ninvestments.

Specifically, for life insurance linked to internal investment portfolios or other reference assets, only the limits of the Circular apply.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's highlighted that while the general rules about \\\"Exposure to a counterparty\\\" and \\\"Securities lending and repurchase agreements\\\" are to be observed, these limits may be exceeded if the policyholder has been expressly informed of the potential deviation from these limits before the contract is concluded. \\n\\nThis approach allows for flexibility in managing the investments linked to unit-linked life insurance policies, provided that there is clear communication with the policyholders about the investment limits and any possible deviations from standard limits. \\n\\nIn summary, while the broader investment principles and limits of the Circular must be respected, there is specific guidance for unit-linked life insurance tied assets that allows for certain exceptions, especially when policyholders are made aware of these exceptions in advance.\",\n          \"If the custodian bank is located abroad, specific regulations concerning safekeeping must be adhered to, as referenced in the text provided. These regulations are crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of the assets under the custodian bank's care. While the text mentions the need for compliance with provisions regarding safekeeping abroad, detailed in margin numbers 156 and 157, it doesn't elaborate on the specifics of these provisions within the provided excerpt.\\n\\nHowever, based on common regulatory practices concerning custodian banks located abroad, we can infer that such regulations typically include:\\n\\n1. **Regulatory Compliance**: The custodian bank must comply with the regulatory requirements of both the home country where the fund management company is based and the host country where the custodian bank operates. This often involves understanding and adhering to international finance regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, and any specific investment regulations of the home country.\\n\\n2. **Risk Management**: There must be effective risk management strategies in place to handle risks associated with foreign exchange transactions, jurisdictional legal risks, and the operational risks of dealing with foreign entities.\\n\\n3. **Operational Integrity**: The custodian bank should have robust systems for record-keeping, transaction processing, and ensuring the security of the assets under its care. This includes having adequate cybersecurity measures and physical security for safeguarding assets.\\n\\n4. **Information and Inspection Rights**: As outlined in the text, there's an obligation for the fund management company, the custodian bank, and other service providers to provide information in accordance with Art. 29 FINMASA and allow FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) to conduct on-site inspections. This ensures that there's transparency and accountability in the operations of the custodian bank, especially concerning its safekeeping practices.\\n\\n5. **Contractual Agreements**: It is contractually agreed upon that these entities have a duty to provide information to FINMA as per Art. 29 FINMASA and to permit on-site inspections by FINMA at the respective service providers' locations.\\n\\nWhile specific regulations (margin nos. 156 and 157) were mentioned, the overarching principle is that custodian banks, especially those located abroad, must operate in a manner that ensures the protection and proper management of the assets they are entrusted with, while also facilitating regulatory oversight and compliance with relevant local and international laws.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In particular, this is intended to \\navoid the previously separate safeguarding of the savings and guarantee components.89\\nThis Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined \\nlimits, the coverage obligations and the qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be \\ntaken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization \\ntransactions (insurance classes A2.1-A2.6 as well as A6.1 and A6.2), however, exceptions \\napply with regard to the limits (see margin no. 122).90\\nb) Foreign insurance portfolio\\nThe insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied \\nassets if equivalent security must be provided abroad (Art. 17 para. 2 ISA). If no equivalent \\nsecurity has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the \\nprovision can be made in separate tied assets (Art. 77 para. 2 let. b SO).91\\nIf there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in \\nSwitzerland.92\\nThe following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: 93\\n\\u2022Special assets 94\\n\\n### Section: Page 14\\n14/70There is an obligation to cover the entire technical provisions from direct insurance \\nthrough a special fund. The gross technical provisions must be covered (without taking \\ninto account claims against reinsurers). If an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured \\nportions of the provisions (see margin nos. 160-175) exists for insurance companies that \\noperate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. It must be ensured \\nthat only those contracts participate in the special fund that are fully included in the target \\namount.\\nInstead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into \\naccount, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the \\ninsurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets.95\\nFor these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. 96\\n\\u2022Bankruptcy privilege\\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the special assets are primarily available to satisfy claims arising \\nfrom insurance contracts.97\\n\\u2022Investment guidelines\\nThe local supervisory authority specifies investment guidelines aimed at maintaining the \\nsecurity and value of the investment fund.98\\nc) Unit-linked life insurance policies\\nUnit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions must be linked to permissible \\nassets for the tied assets: In the case of unit-linked contracts, these are open-ended collective \\ninvestment schemes that fall under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA; SR 951.31) \\n(Art. 125a SO). In the case of contracts linked to internal investment portfolios or other \\nreference values, these are permissible values in accordance with Art. 79 SO and Art. 81 \\npara. 2 SO.99\\nThe investments used as collateral must correspond to those on which the contracts are \\nbased (matching cover; Art. 81 AVO), as otherwise the insurance company bears an \\nadditional investment risk. Any guarantees must be secured with investments in accordance \\nwith Art. 79 AVO that replicate the fluctuations in value of these guarantees as well as \\npossible. Other contractual components, non-unit-linked provisions and any supplement to the \\ntarget amount must be secured with values in accordance with Art. 79 AVO.100\\nIn accordance with Art. 93a AVO, investments to secure claims from unit-linked life insurance \\npolicies are valued at no more than market value, irrespective of\\nthe other capitalized values in accordance with Chapter IV.101\\n\\n### Section: Page 15\\n15/70d) Indirect investments: Initial acquisition, restructuring\\nAn investment - whether as an initial acquisition or through restructuring - in so-called indirect \\ninvestments (e.g. in funds, participations, structured products or bonds issued by special \\npurpose vehicles [SPVs]) may not be used to circumvent the provisions on direct investments \\nin accordance with Chapter IV.102\\nThis circular deals with the following indirect investments:\\n\\u2022collective investment schemes in accordance with margin nos. 484-493;\\n\\u2022Single investor funds according to margin nos. 494-505;\\n\\u2022Real estate companies in accordance with margin no. 256 (for a participation of more than \\n50%) or margin no. 240 (as a listed real estate company);\\n\\u2022structured products and securitized receivables in accordance with margin nos. 197 and \\n214;\\n\\u2022alternative investments in accordance with margin nos. 317-350.103\\nDepending on the instrument, specific qualitative requirements and a high level of liquidity are \\ndemanded for the entire investment instrument or a so-called look-through approach is \\napplied. An investment in an indirect investment that contains a non-eligible direct investment \\nis only permitted if the specific provisions for the indirect investment are met and its \\ncharacteristics mean that the disadvantages that lead to the non-eligibility of the direct \\ninvestment do not affect the indirect investment.104\\nExample: An investment in real estate that is relatively illiquid and difficult to value and is \\ntherefore not a permissible investment in tied assets cannot be counted as a permissible \\ninvestment even if it is restructured as an indirect investment. It can only be included if the risk \\nsituation for the investor actually improves, as illustrated by the following list based on an \\ninvestment in real estate.105\\n106Structure Creditable?

The collateral is set up in the name of the \\ninsurance company. The collateral should be transferred at the same time as the \\nsecurities are delivered.524\\n\\u2022The custodian (custodian bank) for the collateral must comply with the guidelines for the \\nsafekeeping of assets (margin nos. 154-159) and have signed the corresponding model \\nagreement.525\\n\\u2022The value of the collateral must be appropriate and amount to at least 105% of the market \\nvalue of the securities lent at all times. If bonds with a credit rating of 3 (or better) are lent \\nand the collateral is provided in the same currency as cash or bonds with a credit rating of \\n1, the value of the collateral must be at least 102% of the market value of the securities \\nlent.526\\n\\u2022The collateral must comply with the investment regulations for direct investments in tied \\nassets. The collateral must be capable of being valued and traded on a daily basis and \\ncorrespond to credit quality step 3 or better and must not have been issued by the \\ncounterparty or relate to it.527\\n\\u2022Collateral received may not be repledged, lent, sold or used in the context of derivative \\ntransactions, securities lending or repurchase agreements.\\nCash collateral can be reinvested in highly liquid, short-term money market investments \\nand highly liquid bonds with a (residual) term of up to a maximum of twelve months. Due \\nto the fact that the cash collateral can be recalled from the borrower at any time, the \\ninsurance company must have sufficient liquidity. Strategies and guidelines for the \\nreinvestment of cash collateral are part of the insurance company's investment policy and \\nrisk management (including stress tests under various tighter market conditions) and are \\ndocumented, periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.528\\n\\u2022It must be ensured that the insurance company has full and unconditional access to the \\ncollateral if the counterparty does not return the borrowed securities, does not return them \\non time or only partially returns them. Any third-party claims against the insurance \\ncompany must not affect access to the collateral.\\ntainers.

They are recognized at a \\nmaximum of the current market value or at a maximum of the recognition value at the time of \\nlending, if this is lower.533\\nThe collateral received is allocated to the tied assets and must be identified as such. The \\ncollateral may not be taken into account when calculating the cover of the tied assets, as the \\nsecurities lent are taken into account.534\\nUnderlying assets that have been lent are marked \\\"lent\\\" in the list of tied assets.

Repurchase agreements\\na) Definition\\nA repo (repurchase agreement) is a legal transaction in which one party (lender) transfers \\nownership of securities to another party (borrower) in return for payment and in which the \\nborrower undertakes to return securities of the same type, quantity and quality to the lender \\non maturity, as well as the income accruing during the term of the repurchase agreement. As \\nthe repurchase amount is determined in advance, the lender bears the price risk of the \\nsecurities during the term of the repurchase agreement.538\\nReverse repo (reverse repurchase agreement): Repo from the perspective of the lender. 539\\nRepo interest: Difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the securities. 540\\nWhile legal ownership of the securities in a repo transaction is transferred to the lender or \\nborrower (legal owner), the lender or borrower remains the beneficial owner. Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due in the course of the repo transaction are due to the lender. If \\ncontractually agreed, the seller may repurchase the securities sold prematurely, whereby the \\nrespective value date/delivery deadlines must be taken into account for the delivery of the \\nsecurities. As a beneficial owner, the pension provider bears the risks of fluctuations in the \\nsecurities and takes these into account when adding the securities to the tied assets.541\\nb) Purpose\\nThe repo transaction serves the purpose of obtaining short-term liquidity. Reverse repo is a \\nshort-term collateralized investment of surplus liquidity.542\\nc) Permitted transactions\\nRepurchase agreements are permitted under the following conditions: 543\\n\\u2022Framework agreement\\nThe insurance undertaking concludes the necessary framework agreements with the \\ncounterparty to the repurchase agreement (margin nos. 552-557).544\\n\\u2022Repo trading platform and settlement system\\nRepo transactions must be executed on an established repo trading platform that meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\n\\u2022central administration of the multilateral treaty system;\\n\\u2022simultaneous processing of the transaction;545\\n\\n### Section: Page 65\\n65/70\\u2022mapping of processes in real time;\\n\\u2022daily valuation (mark-to-market, at least once a day) of all open repo positions and\",\n          \"10/70acquisition of new business or business growth) sufficient assets are available to cover the \\ntarget amount of the tied assets.\\ne) Order\\nThe insurance company establishes the tied assets by allocating assets. It records and \\nidentifies these assets in such a way that it can prove at any time without delay which assets \\nbelong to the tied assets and that the target amount of each tied asset is covered (Art. 76 \\npara. 1 AVO).47\\nf) Criteria for the allocation of assets to restricted assets\\nAn asset can be allocated to restricted assets if: 48\\n\\u2022the investment is an admissible value in accordance with Art. 79 or Art. 68 para. 2 SO and \\nis eligible in accordance with this Circular. Partial crediting of investments (e.g. due to \\nnon-creditable parts or increased risks) is not permitted. Partial offsetting of the \\ninvestment is only possible if the exception is explicitly described in this circular (e.g. \\nmortgages, margin no. 312);49\\n\\u2022the investment can generally be valued without any problems; 50\\n\\u2022the investment has a high level of liquidity in relation to the corresponding investment \\ncategory;51\\n\\u2022the necessary expertise is available and appropriate processes and systems are applied \\nthat are necessary for the professional selection, management and control of the \\ninvestment made (margin no. 76);52\\n\\u2022The effects of the investment and its individual risk components are understood so that \\nthe financial, legal and operational risks can be assessed at all times;53\\n\\u2022the debtor's creditworthiness is verifiable (margin no. 139-152); 54\\n\\u2022the asset is neither encumbered nor can it be offset against third-party claims (margin no. 38). 55\\nThese principles are specified for each investment category in Chapters IV and V. 56\\nC. Investment strategy\\nThe Executive Board determines the investment strategy and submits it to the Board of Directors \\nfor approval (Art. 78 para. 1 let. a, Art. 101 SO).57\\nThe investment strategy takes appropriate account of the type and complexity of the business \\nconducted, in particular the insurance business (Art. 102 para. 1 SO).58\\n\\n### Section: Page 11\\n11/70The framework conditions for the use of the various investment categories must be defined in \\nthe investment strategy. All investments must be anchored in the investment strategy of the \\ncompany as a whole.59\\nThe limits of risk exposure must be set in accordance with the financial and organizational \\ncapacities of the insurance company.60\\nD. Investment regulations\\nThe investment regulations are issued by the Executive Board or a member of the Executive \\nBoard or the general representative and define the entire investment activity (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. b, Art. 106 para. 1 SO). The investment activity is comprehensively described in a \\ndocument, whereby specific references to other internal directives are possible.61\\nThe requirements for the investment regulations are based on the complexity of the investments \\nin the investment universe defined by the insurance company.62\\nThe insurance company regulates at least the following topics in the investment regulations: 63\\n\\u2022Internal investment principles and objectives (incl. ALM); 64\\n\\u2022Description of the investment universe (permitted investments / restrictions); 65\\n\\u2022Investment techniques and their area of application/purpose (e.g. use of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, securities lending, repurchase agreements);66\\n\\u2022Description of the investment process, monitoring and controls (definition of tasks, \\nresponsibilities, competencies, accountability and escalation mechanisms);67\\n\\u2022Staff requirements (e.g. specialist knowledge, experience, integrity). 68\\nE. Organization and control\\nThe administration (investment management) and control (risk management) of the \\ninvestment activity must be carried out by persons who are independent of each other and \\nmust be organizationally appropriate to the complexity of the business and investment activity \\n(Art. 78, 106 SO).69\\nThe staff must have adequate qualifications and knowledge of the asset classes invested in \\nand, in the case of investments in riskier investments, appropriate expertise (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. c, Art. 107 SO).70\\nThe systems used should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the investment portfolio, \\nbe monitored and have the necessary stability (Art. 106 para. 2 SO).71\\n\\n### Section: Page 12\\n12/70The administration (investment management) must ensure and perform at least the following \\ntasks:72\\n\\u2022the implementation of the investment strategy and the investment regulations; 73\\n\\u2022the definition and documentation of the strategic and tactical asset allocation, which is \\nadapted to the risk capacity, size and complexity of the insurance company, whereby the \\nallocation is made in relation to asset classes and other important characteristics such as \\nduration, sectors, creditworthiness and investment styles;74\\n\\u2022setting a limit system based on individual risk capacity, monitoring limits and defining \\nmeasures in the event of limit breaches;75\\n\\u2022the provision of an investment process that is commensurate with the complexity of the \\ninvestments. Scenario analyses must be used to ensure that the use of complex \\ninvestments does not jeopardize the value of the total assets and tied assets or the \\nsolvency of the insurance company;76\\n\\u2022monitoring the value of the assets; 77\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 78\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities;79\\n\\u2022the measurement and evaluation of investment results; 80\\n\\u2022the definition of internal reporting. 81\\nIf the insurance company commissions a third party with investment management, this does \\nnot relieve it of responsibility for compliance with the investment management regulations. In \\nparticular, the insurance company must understand the investment process, monitor the \\nspecified strategy and investment principles and be able to track all transactions in a timely \\nmanner for accounting purposes.82\\nThe transfer of investment management to third parties is subject to FINMA approval in \\naccordance with Art. 4 para. 2 let. j ISA.83\\nControl (risk management) must ensure and perform at least the following tasks: 84\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives in \\naccordance with margin no. 64 and the other internal directives of the insurance company;85\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 86\\n\\n### Section: Page 13\\n13/70\\u2022monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities.87\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 280,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes, derivatives used to hedge cash flows from underwriting obligations can be settled before maturity. The circumstances under which they can be settled before maturity include the necessity for internal reporting to justify the early closeout. Specifically, it is likely that the derivatives can be held until maturity as part of their hedging strategy. However, derivatives that are closed out before maturity must be justified in internal reporting. This means there must be a valid reason documented internally for the early settlement of these derivatives. Additionally, the use of these derivatives must be geared towards a sustainable effect and specifically, derivative contracts must not be concluded for the purpose of speculation.\",\n          \"The documentation specifies the handling of investment limits for unit-linked life insurance in relation to the tied assets by outlining that the tied assets must be determined based on the assets underlying the contracts. This means that the quantitative limits set forth in the document do not apply to the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance. Specifically, for life insurance linked to internal investment portfolios or other reference assets, only the limits of the Circular apply.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's highlighted that while the general rules about \\\"Exposure to a counterparty\\\" and \\\"Securities lending and repurchase agreements\\\" are to be observed, these limits may be exceeded if the policyholder has been expressly informed of the potential deviation from these limits before the contract is concluded. \\n\\nThis approach allows for flexibility in managing the investments linked to unit-linked life insurance policies, provided that there is clear communication with the policyholders about the investment limits and any possible deviations from standard limits. \\n\\nIn summary, while the broader investment principles and limits of the Circular must be respected, there is specific guidance for unit-linked life insurance tied assets that allows for certain exceptions, especially when policyholders are made aware of these exceptions in advance.\",\n          \"If the custodian bank is located abroad, specific regulations concerning safekeeping must be adhered to, as referenced in the text provided.

While the text mentions the need for compliance with provisions regarding safekeeping abroad, detailed in margin numbers 156 and 157, it doesn't elaborate on the specifics of these provisions within the provided excerpt.\\n\\nHowever, based on common regulatory practices concerning custodian banks located abroad, we can infer that such regulations typically include:\\n\\n1. **Regulatory Compliance**: The custodian bank must comply with the regulatory requirements of both the home country where the fund management company is based and the host country where the custodian bank operates. This often involves understanding and adhering to international finance regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, and any specific investment regulations of the home country.\\n\\n2. **Risk Management**: There must be effective risk management strategies in place to handle risks associated with foreign exchange transactions, jurisdictional legal risks, and the operational risks of dealing with foreign entities.\\n\\n3. **Operational Integrity**: The custodian bank should have robust systems for record-keeping, transaction processing, and ensuring the security of the assets under its care. This includes having adequate cybersecurity measures and physical security for safeguarding assets.\\n\\n4. **Information and Inspection Rights**: As outlined in the text, there's an obligation for the fund management company, the custodian bank, and other service providers to provide information in accordance with Art. 29 FINMASA and allow FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) to conduct on-site inspections. This ensures that there's transparency and accountability in the operations of the custodian bank, especially concerning its safekeeping practices.\\n\\n5. **Contractual Agreements**: It is contractually agreed upon that these entities have a duty to provide information to FINMA as per Art. 29 FINMASA and to permit on-site inspections by FINMA at the respective service providers' locations.\\n\\nWhile specific regulations (margin nos. 156 and 157) were mentioned, the overarching principle is that custodian banks, especially those located abroad, must operate in a manner that ensures the protection and proper management of the assets they are entrusted with, while also facilitating regulatory oversight and compliance with relevant local and international laws.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chapters II and III set out FINMA\\'s expectations with regard to the overall \\ninvestment activity of all supervised insurance companies and, in particular, the general \\nrequirements in connection with the designation of tied assets (Art. 17 of the Insurance \\nSupervision Act [ISA; SR 961.01]). Chapters IV and V explain the requirements for the \\npermissible assets in tied assets (Art. 79 of the Supervision Ordinance [SO; SR 961.011]).1\\nII General principles for total assets\\nA. Investment principles\\nWhen selecting its investments, the insurance company takes into account the structure and \\ndevelopment of the obligations (asset liability management, ALM), the security of the \\ninvestments, appropriate diversification and the insurance company\\'s foreseeable need for \\nliquid assets.2\\nB. Derivative financial instruments\\na) Use of derivative financial instruments\\nInsurance companies may only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risks on the \\ninvestments or on their obligations to the insured persons or to manage the investments \\nefficiently (Art. 100 SO).3\\nWhen using derivatives, the insurance company may not take any risks that are inappropriate \\nto the scope of business and risk capacity of the insurance company. The use of derivatives \\nshould also be aimed at achieving a sustainable effect.4\\nb) Obligation to provide cover when using derivatives\\nIn accordance with Art. 100 para. 2 SO, all obligations that may arise from derivative financial \\ntransactions must be covered. The obligations must be covered at all times and in full \\n(contract volume / notional value) either by the underlying assets on which the derivatives are \\nbased (in the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell) or by liquidity (in the case of \\nderivatives with an obligation to buy).5\\nLiquidity can include both cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents\\nCash deposits in accordance with margin nos. 181-185 and government bonds with a minimum \\ncredit rating of 2 and very good liquidity are considered funds. In addition, the funds mentioned in \\nmargin no. 1146\\n\\n### Section: Page 4\\n4/70Receivables that are exempt from the counterparty limit are regarded as cash equivalents.\\nThe obligation is covered at all times and in full if: 7\\n•the liquidity or cash equivalents are available; 8\\n•the underlying assets are held by the insurance company and are available without \\nrestriction - securities lending in relation to the underlying assets and repurchase \\nagreements (repo, reverse repo) in connection with derivative transactions are not \\npermitted. Lent securities are an exception if the short-term recall of these securities is \\npossible without restriction. The increased operational risks arising from these \\ntransactions must be taken into account;9\\n•double use of liquidity or underlying assets to cover several transactions is excluded - \\nunderlying assets or liquidity can be used simultaneously to cover derivative positions if \\nthese involve several risks (e.g. a market, credit or currency risk) but relate to the same \\nunderlying assets;10\\n•the market value of the cash equivalents or the number of underlying assets covers the \\nentire obligation, whereby cash equivalents - with the exception of cash deposits in \\naccordance with margin nos. 181-185 - may only be used as cover to the extent of 90% of \\nthe market value.11\\nIn the case of derivatives with a purchase or acceptance obligation (e.g. long futures, long \\nforwards, short puts) of an underlying asset, such as a share, a financial index, a currency or \\nan interest rate, the liquidity required to fulfill the obligation must be available at all times.12\\nIn the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell or deliver (e.g. short futures, short forwards, \\nshort calls) an underlying asset, such as a share, a currency or an interest rate, the underlying \\ninvestment must be available at all times and without restriction to fulfill the obligation. In the \\ncase of index derivatives, the obligations are deemed to be covered if there is an extensive \\nand stable correlation between the underlying assets held and the index.13\\nIf there is a contractual right to satisfy an obligation entered into by means of a cash payment \\ninstead of delivery of the deliverable underlying, the physically deliverable underlying must \\nnevertheless be held.14\\nIf cash settlement is mandatory for underlyings that cannot be physically delivered (e.g. \\nunderlyings for weather derivatives), the necessary liquidity must be maintained in full at all \\ntimes in the event of an obligation to sell such derivatives.15\\nIn the case of derivatives with an obligation to exchange cash flows (e.g. interest rate swaps), \\nthe cash flow to be paid must be ensured with the necessary liquidity or underlying.\\nbecome.16\\n\\n### Section: Page 5\\n5/70In the case of combinations of derivatives, the obligations of the entire combination for the \\nfulfillment of the obligations must be covered at all times by underlying assets or liquidity \\navailable in the assets. The underlyings of the combinations must be identical to the \\nunderlyings used as cover.17\\nc) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance undertakings that use derivative financial instruments must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (margin no. 76).18\\nThe provisions of margin nos. 57-87 m u s t  also be observed mutatis mutandis when using \\nderivative financial instruments.19\\nd) Analysis of the risks associated with the use of derivative financial instruments\\nThe counterparty risks resulting from derivative transactions must be taken into account \\nbefore derivative financial instruments are used. The risks must be analyzed as often as the \\nsituation requires, but at least once a week for market risks and once a month for credit risks. \\nThe analysis of market and credit risks consists, among other things, of evaluating the open \\npositions and comparing them with the defined limits of risk exposure. The result of the risk \\nanalysis must be presented to the Executive Board as often as the situation requires, but at \\nleast once a month for market risks and at least once every three months for credit risks (Art. \\n104 SO).20\\nThe insurance company\\'s risk management ensures that the derivative strategies of different \\ndivisions are recorded centrally and analyzed for interdependencies. To this end, various \\nrelevant scenario calculations must be carried out to ensure that the overall use of derivatives \\ndoes not jeopardize the value of the assets or the solvency of the company. The insurance \\ncompany ensures that the economic impact on assets and solvency in connection with \\nderivative transactions is correctly shown in the various reports to FINMA.21\\nAccording to Art. 108 SO, an activity report on the use of derivative financial instruments must \\nbe submitted to the Board of Directors at least every six months.22\\nIII General principles for tied assets\\nA. Definition, purpose and obligation to appoint\\nThe values in the tied assets represent based on the\\nThe assets secure the claims of the insured persons based on the reported technical 23\\n\\n### Section: Page 6\\n6/70provisions. The\\n\\n### Section: Page 7\\n7/70Tied assets are of great importance in the event of a portfolio transfer and especially in the \\nevent of insolvency and the subsequent liquidation of the insurance company. The tied assets \\nprovide the insured persons with a liability substrate that ensures that their claims are satisfied \\nwith priority over other creditors in the event of the insurance company\\'s bankruptcy.\\nThe assets allocated to the tied assets must be secure, unencumbered property of the \\ninsurance company and realizable in the event of the bankruptcy of the insurance company in \\nSwitzerland. To ensure that the claims of the insured persons are effectively secured, \\nattention must be paid to the intrinsic value and stability of value when allocating assets to tied \\nassets.24\\nB. Principles\\na) Investment principles\\naa) Security\\nThe investments in tied assets must be selected in such a way that the claims arising from \\ninsurance contracts can be met at all times.25\\nThe security of investments is guaranteed if they are economically and legally secure. \\nEconomic security is understood to mean the preservation of the value of the capital or \\nassets; the legal security of the investments is measured by their availability and saleability. \\nThe requirement of economic and legal security applies to both direct and indirect \\ninvestments.26\\nThe following criteria in particular must be observed with regard to maintaining the value of \\nassets:\\n•the fluctuation in value of the total tied assets, whereby the extent of the fluctuation in \\nvalue that can be tolerated depends on the level of overfunding of the tied assets;\\n•the quality of the system;\\n•a reliable valuation method for the system.27\\nThe legal security of the system relates in particular to the following criteria:\\n•unrestricted power of disposal;\\n•the unrestricted saleability and transferability of the assets, in particular in the event of the \\ninsurance company\\'s bankruptcy.28\\nAssets that jeopardize the intrinsic value of the tied assets (e.g. assets that give rise to additional \\nfunding obligations at the expense of the tied assets) are not permitted.\\nassets).29\\n\\n### Section: Page 8\\n8/70bb) Orientation towards obligations (Asset Liability Management, ALM)\\nThe order of the tied assets must be based on the structure and expected development of the \\ninsurance obligations to be secured. Appropriate account must be taken of both the \\nperformance of investments and liabilities and the expected cash flows from investments and \\nobligations.30\\ncc) Profitability\\nThe insurance company selects investments that generate a return in line with the market. 31\\ndd) Diversification\\nEach tied asset must be sufficiently and appropriately diversified. Cluster risks must be \\nexcluded. An appropriate mix in relation to the various investment categories and a spread of \\ninvestments in relation to the debtors of the assets must be achieved.32\\nAn appropriate mix of investments with regard to the various investment categories takes into \\naccount the following criteria in particular:\\n•the specific risk profile and default risk or impairment risk of the investments;\\n•the investment horizon (i.e. investment period) of the investment;\\n•the correlation of asset classes.33\\nAn appropriate diversification of investments takes into account at least the following criteria:\\n•various counterparties;\\n•different geographical regions;\\n•different industries and segments.34\\nInvestments in high-risk investments may only be made as a cautious addition to and \\nappropriate diversification of the total tied assets. The risk capacity of the insurance company \\nmust always be taken into account. Investments in securities with a credit rating of 5 are only \\npermitted if there is corresponding technical expertise in the area of credit risks.35\\nee) Liquidity\\nIn principle, the insurance company must choose investments that can be realized quickly if \\nnecessary, especially in the event of the insurance company\\'s bankruptcy.36\\nThe realizability of an investment depends, among other things, on the term of an investment \\n(e.g. bonds, fixed-term deposits) or the possibility of assigning (selling) the investment on the \\nmarket or on a stock exchange.37\\n\\n### Section: Page 9\\n9/70b) Prohibition of charging and offsetting\\nThe value of the tied assets must be unencumbered (Art. 84 para. 2 SO). In principle, the tied \\nassets may not be encumbered by liens, rights of retention, rights of set-off or similar rights. \\nNo additional funding obligations may be created to the detriment of the tied assets. \\nExceptions are set out in Chapters IV and V.38\\nc) Realization in bankruptcy\\nThe assets in tied assets serve solely to secure claims arising from insurance contracts in the \\nevent of the insolvency and liquidation of the insurance company under bankruptcy law. It \\nmust therefore be ensured that the assets flow into the bankruptcy estate and can be \\nliquidated in Swiss bankruptcy proceedings.39\\nThe recoverability in bankruptcy must be ensured by the insurance company, whereby proof can \\nbe provided as follows:40\\n•The investment is securitized and traded on a market so that a market price can be \\ndetermined; or41\\n•the legal system applicable to the investment recognizes FINMA\\'s insolvency proceedings \\nand the priority privilege of tied assets under Swiss law, so that special executions or \\nother interventions by an authority or third parties are not possible.42\\nAt FINMA\\'s request, the possibility of realizability in Swiss bankruptcy must be demonstrated. 43\\nd) Obligation to provide cover at all times\\nThe insurance company shall take suitable organizational measures to ensure that the current \\ndebit amount pursuant to Art. 56 and 57 or 68 SO is covered at all times by permissible assets \\npursuant to Art. 68 para. 2, 79 and 81 SO. The amount of the current target amount is \\ndetermined on the basis of the current provisions if a statement of account were prepared at \\nthat time.44\\nInstead of a concrete calculation of the current provisions, well-founded and prudent estimates \\ncan also be used during the year, provided that it can be demonstrated with a high degree of \\ncertainty that the current target amount is actually covered by the calculated values.45\\nThis ensures that even after events and developments occurring during the year that require \\nfurther technical provisions and require a\\nhave an influence on the target amount (e.g. unexpected claims, need for additional reserves),46\\n\\n### Section: Page 10\\n10/70acquisition of new business or business growth) sufficient assets are available to cover the \\ntarget amount of the tied assets.\\ne) Order\\nThe insurance company establishes the tied assets by allocating assets. It records and \\nidentifies these assets in such a way that it can prove at any time without delay which assets \\nbelong to the tied assets and that the target amount of each tied asset is covered (Art. 76 \\npara. 1 AVO).47\\nf) Criteria for the allocation of assets to restricted assets\\nAn asset can be allocated to restricted assets if: 48\\n•the investment is an admissible value in accordance with Art. 79 or Art. 68 para. 2 SO and \\nis eligible in accordance with this Circular. Partial crediting of investments (e.g. due to \\nnon-creditable parts or increased risks) is not permitted. Partial offsetting of the \\ninvestment is only possible if the exception is explicitly described in this circular (e.g. \\nmortgages, margin no. 312);49\\n•the investment can generally be valued without any problems; 50\\n•the investment has a high level of liquidity in relation to the corresponding investment \\ncategory;51\\n•the necessary expertise is available and appropriate processes and systems are applied \\nthat are necessary for the professional selection, management and control of the \\ninvestment made (margin no. 76);52\\n•The effects of the investment and its individual risk components are understood so that \\nthe financial, legal and operational risks can be assessed at all times;53\\n•the debtor\\'s creditworthiness is verifiable (margin no. 139-152); 54\\n•the asset is neither encumbered nor can it be offset against third-party claims (margin no. 38). 55\\nThese principles are specified for each investment category in Chapters IV and V. 56\\nC. Investment strategy\\nThe Executive Board determines the investment strategy and submits it to the Board of Directors \\nfor approval (Art. 78 para. 1 let. a, Art. 101 SO).57\\nThe investment strategy takes appropriate account of the type and complexity of the business \\nconducted, in particular the insurance business (Art. 102 para. 1 SO).58\\n\\n### Section: Page 11\\n11/70The framework conditions for the use of the various investment categories must be defined in \\nthe investment strategy. All investments must be anchored in the investment strategy of the \\ncompany as a whole.59\\nThe limits of risk exposure must be set in accordance with the financial and organizational \\ncapacities of the insurance company.60\\nD. Investment regulations\\nThe investment regulations are issued by the Executive Board or a member of the Executive \\nBoard or the general representative and define the entire investment activity (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. b, Art. 106 para. 1 SO). The investment activity is comprehensively described in a \\ndocument, whereby specific references to other internal directives are possible.61\\nThe requirements for the investment regulations are based on the complexity of the investments \\nin the investment universe defined by the insurance company.62\\nThe insurance company regulates at least the following topics in the investment regulations: 63\\n•Internal investment principles and objectives (incl. ALM); 64\\n•Description of the investment universe (permitted investments / restrictions); 65\\n•Investment techniques and their area of application/purpose (e.g. use of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, securities lending, repurchase agreements);66\\n•Description of the investment process, monitoring and controls (definition of tasks, \\nresponsibilities, competencies, accountability and escalation mechanisms);67\\n•Staff requirements (e.g. specialist knowledge, experience, integrity). 68\\nE. Organization and control\\nThe administration (investment management) and control (risk management) of the \\ninvestment activity must be carried out by persons who are independent of each other and \\nmust be organizationally appropriate to the complexity of the business and investment activity \\n(Art. 78, 106 SO).69\\nThe staff must have adequate qualifications and knowledge of the asset classes invested in \\nand, in the case of investments in riskier investments, appropriate expertise (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. c, Art. 107 SO).70\\nThe systems used should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the investment portfolio, \\nbe monitored and have the necessary stability (Art. 106 para. 2 SO).71\\n\\n### Section: Page 12\\n12/70The administration (investment management) must ensure and perform at least the following \\ntasks:72\\n•the implementation of the investment strategy and the investment regulations; 73\\n•the definition and documentation of the strategic and tactical asset allocation, which is \\nadapted to the risk capacity, size and complexity of the insurance company, whereby the \\nallocation is made in relation to asset classes and other important characteristics such as \\nduration, sectors, creditworthiness and investment styles;74\\n•setting a limit system based on individual risk capacity, monitoring limits and defining \\nmeasures in the event of limit breaches;75\\n•the provision of an investment process that is commensurate with the complexity of the \\ninvestments. Scenario analyses must be used to ensure that the use of complex \\ninvestments does not jeopardize the value of the total assets and tied assets or the \\nsolvency of the insurance company;76\\n•monitoring the value of the assets; 77\\n•monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 78\\n•monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities;79\\n•the measurement and evaluation of investment results; 80\\n•the definition of internal reporting. 81\\nIf the insurance company commissions a third party with investment management, this does \\nnot relieve it of responsibility for compliance with the investment management regulations. In \\nparticular, the insurance company must understand the investment process, monitor the \\nspecified strategy and investment principles and be able to track all transactions in a timely \\nmanner for accounting purposes.82\\nThe transfer of investment management to third parties is subject to FINMA approval in \\naccordance with Art. 4 para. 2 let. j ISA.83\\nControl (risk management) must ensure and perform at least the following tasks: 84\\n•monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives in \\naccordance with margin no. 64 and the other internal directives of the insurance company;85\\n•monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 86\\n\\n### Section: Page 13\\n13/70•monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities.87\\nF. Further provisions\\na) Separate tied assets\\nSeparate tied assets are to be ordered for (Art. 77 para. 1 AVO):\\n•occupational pension insurance;\\n•the policyholder claims from unit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions \\n(insurance classes A2.1, A2.2, A2.3 and A6.1);\\n•the policyholder claims from insurance contracts or capitalization transactions that are \\nlinked to internal investment portfolios or other reference values (insurance sections A2.4, \\nA2.5, A2.6 and A6.2).\\nThe appointment of further tied assets is possible (Art. 77 para. 2 SO) and may be ordered by \\nFINMA in justified cases (para. 3).88\\nIn Art. 77 para. 1 let. b and c AVO, reference is no longer made to the savings portion of the \\ninsurance contracts, but to the entire insured persons\\' claims. In particular, this is intended to \\navoid the previously separate safeguarding of the savings and guarantee components.89\\nThis Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined \\nlimits, the coverage obligations and the qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be \\ntaken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization \\ntransactions (insurance classes A2.1-A2.6 as well as A6.1 and A6.2), however, exceptions \\napply with regard to the limits (see margin no. 122).90\\nb) Foreign insurance portfolio\\nThe insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied \\nassets if equivalent security must be provided abroad (Art. 17 para. 2 ISA). If no equivalent \\nsecurity has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the \\nprovision can be made in separate tied assets (Art. 77 para. 2 let. b SO).91\\nIf there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in \\nSwitzerland.92\\nThe following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: 93\\n•Special assets 94\\n\\n### Section: Page 14\\n14/70There is an obligation to cover the entire technical provisions from direct insurance \\nthrough a special fund. The gross technical provisions must be covered (without taking \\ninto account claims against reinsurers). If an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured \\nportions of the provisions (see margin nos. 160-175) exists for insurance companies that \\noperate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. It must be ensured \\nthat only those contracts participate in the special fund that are fully included in the target \\namount.\\nInstead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into \\naccount, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the \\ninsurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets.95\\nFor these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. 96\\n•Bankruptcy privilege\\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the special assets are primarily available to satisfy claims arising \\nfrom insurance contracts.97\\n•Investment guidelines\\nThe local supervisory authority specifies investment guidelines aimed at maintaining the \\nsecurity and value of the investment fund.98\\nc) Unit-linked life insurance policies\\nUnit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions must be linked to permissible \\nassets for the tied assets: In the case of unit-linked contracts, these are open-ended collective \\ninvestment schemes that fall under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA; SR 951.31) \\n(Art. 125a SO). In the case of contracts linked to internal investment portfolios or other \\nreference values, these are permissible values in accordance with Art. 79 SO and Art. 81 \\npara. 2 SO.99\\nThe investments used as collateral must correspond to those on which the contracts are \\nbased (matching cover; Art. 81 AVO), as otherwise the insurance company bears an \\nadditional investment risk. Any guarantees must be secured with investments in accordance \\nwith Art. 79 AVO that replicate the fluctuations in value of these guarantees as well as \\npossible. Other contractual components, non-unit-linked provisions and any supplement to the \\ntarget amount must be secured with values in accordance with Art. 79 AVO.100\\nIn accordance with Art. 93a AVO, investments to secure claims from unit-linked life insurance \\npolicies are valued at no more than market value, irrespective of\\nthe other capitalized values in accordance with Chapter IV.101\\n\\n### Section: Page 15\\n15/70d) Indirect investments: Initial acquisition, restructuring\\nAn investment - whether as an initial acquisition or through restructuring - in so-called indirect \\ninvestments (e.g. in funds, participations, structured products or bonds issued by special \\npurpose vehicles [SPVs]) may not be used to circumvent the provisions on direct investments \\nin accordance with Chapter IV.102\\nThis circular deals with the following indirect investments:\\n•collective investment schemes in accordance with margin nos. 484-493;\\n•Single investor funds according to margin nos. 494-505;\\n•Real estate companies in accordance with margin no. 256 (for a participation of more than \\n50%) or margin no. 240 (as a listed real estate company);\\n•structured products and securitized receivables in accordance with margin nos. 197 and \\n214;\\n•alternative investments in accordance with margin nos. 317-350.103\\nDepending on the instrument, specific qualitative requirements and a high level of liquidity are \\ndemanded for the entire investment instrument or a so-called look-through approach is \\napplied. An investment in an indirect investment that contains a non-eligible direct investment \\nis only permitted if the specific provisions for the indirect investment are met and its \\ncharacteristics mean that the disadvantages that lead to the non-eligibility of the direct \\ninvestment do not affect the indirect investment.104\\nExample: An investment in real estate that is relatively illiquid and difficult to value and is \\ntherefore not a permissible investment in tied assets cannot be counted as a permissible \\ninvestment even if it is restructured as an indirect investment. It can only be included if the risk \\nsituation for the investor actually improves, as illustrated by the following list based on an \\ninvestment in real estate.105\\n106Structure Creditable?

In particular, this is intended to \\navoid the previously separate safeguarding of the savings and guarantee components.89\\nThis Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined \\nlimits, the coverage obligations and the qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be \\ntaken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization \\ntransactions (insurance classes A2.1-A2.6 as well as A6.1 and A6.2), however, exceptions \\napply with regard to the limits (see margin no. 122).90\\nb) Foreign insurance portfolio\\nThe insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied \\nassets if equivalent security must be provided abroad (Art. 17 para. 2 ISA). If no equivalent \\nsecurity has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the \\nprovision can be made in separate tied assets (Art. 77 para. 2 let. b SO).91\\nIf there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in \\nSwitzerland.92\\nThe following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: 93\\n\\u2022Special assets 94\\n\\n### Section: Page 14\\n14/70There is an obligation to cover the entire technical provisions from direct insurance \\nthrough a special fund. The gross technical provisions must be covered (without taking \\ninto account claims against reinsurers). If an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured \\nportions of the provisions (see margin nos. 160-175) exists for insurance companies that \\noperate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. It must be ensured \\nthat only those contracts participate in the special fund that are fully included in the target \\namount.\\nInstead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into \\naccount, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the \\ninsurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets.95\\nFor these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. 96\\n\\u2022Bankruptcy privilege\\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the special assets are primarily available to satisfy claims arising \\nfrom insurance contracts.97\\n\\u2022Investment guidelines\\nThe local supervisory authority specifies investment guidelines aimed at maintaining the \\nsecurity and value of the investment fund.98\\nc) Unit-linked life insurance policies\\nUnit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions must be linked to permissible \\nassets for the tied assets: In the case of unit-linked contracts, these are open-ended collective \\ninvestment schemes that fall under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA; SR 951.31) \\n(Art. 125a SO). In the case of contracts linked to internal investment portfolios or other \\nreference values, these are permissible values in accordance with Art. 79 SO and Art. 81 \\npara. 2 SO.99\\nThe investments used as collateral must correspond to those on which the contracts are \\nbased (matching cover; Art. 81 AVO), as otherwise the insurance company bears an \\nadditional investment risk. Any guarantees must be secured with investments in accordance \\nwith Art. 79 AVO that replicate the fluctuations in value of these guarantees as well as \\npossible. Other contractual components, non-unit-linked provisions and any supplement to the \\ntarget amount must be secured with values in accordance with Art. 79 AVO.100\\nIn accordance with Art. 93a AVO, investments to secure claims from unit-linked life insurance \\npolicies are valued at no more than market value, irrespective of\\nthe other capitalized values in accordance with Chapter IV.101\\n\\n### Section: Page 15\\n15/70d) Indirect investments: Initial acquisition, restructuring\\nAn investment - whether as an initial acquisition or through restructuring - in so-called indirect \\ninvestments (e.g. in funds, participations, structured products or bonds issued by special \\npurpose vehicles [SPVs]) may not be used to circumvent the provisions on direct investments \\nin accordance with Chapter IV.102\\nThis circular deals with the following indirect investments:\\n\\u2022collective investment schemes in accordance with margin nos. 484-493;\\n\\u2022Single investor funds according to margin nos. 494-505;\\n\\u2022Real estate companies in accordance with margin no. 256 (for a participation of more than \\n50%) or margin no. 240 (as a listed real estate company);\\n\\u2022structured products and securitized receivables in accordance with margin nos. 197 and \\n214;\\n\\u2022alternative investments in accordance with margin nos. 317-350.103\\nDepending on the instrument, specific qualitative requirements and a high level of liquidity are \\ndemanded for the entire investment instrument or a so-called look-through approach is \\napplied. An investment in an indirect investment that contains a non-eligible direct investment \\nis only permitted if the specific provisions for the indirect investment are met and its \\ncharacteristics mean that the disadvantages that lead to the non-eligibility of the direct \\ninvestment do not affect the indirect investment.104\\nExample: An investment in real estate that is relatively illiquid and difficult to value and is \\ntherefore not a permissible investment in tied assets cannot be counted as a permissible \\ninvestment even if it is restructured as an indirect investment. It can only be included if the risk \\nsituation for the investor actually improves, as illustrated by the following list based on an \\ninvestment in real estate.105\\n106Structure Creditable?

If bonds with a credit rating of 3 (or better) are lent \\nand the collateral is provided in the same currency as cash or bonds with a credit rating of \\n1, the value of the collateral must be at least 102% of the market value of the securities \\nlent.526\\n\\u2022The collateral must comply with the investment regulations for direct investments in tied \\nassets.

They are recognized at a \\nmaximum of the current market value or at a maximum of the recognition value at the time of \\nlending, if this is lower.533\\nThe collateral received is allocated to the tied assets and must be identified as such. The \\ncollateral may not be taken into account when calculating the cover of the tied assets, as the \\nsecurities lent are taken into account.534\\nUnderlying assets that have been lent are marked \\\"lent\\\" in the list of tied assets.

Repurchase agreements\\na) Definition\\nA repo (repurchase agreement) is a legal transaction in which one party (lender) transfers \\nownership of securities to another party (borrower) in return for payment and in which the \\nborrower undertakes to return securities of the same type, quantity and quality to the lender \\non maturity, as well as the income accruing during the term of the repurchase agreement. As \\nthe repurchase amount is determined in advance, the lender bears the price risk of the \\nsecurities during the term of the repurchase agreement.538\\nReverse repo (reverse repurchase agreement): Repo from the perspective of the lender. 539\\nRepo interest: Difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the securities. 540\\nWhile legal ownership of the securities in a repo transaction is transferred to the lender or \\nborrower (legal owner), the lender or borrower remains the beneficial owner. Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due in the course of the repo transaction are due to the lender. If \\ncontractually agreed, the seller may repurchase the securities sold prematurely, whereby the \\nrespective value date/delivery deadlines must be taken into account for the delivery of the \\nsecurities. As a beneficial owner, the pension provider bears the risks of fluctuations in the \\nsecurities and takes these into account when adding the securities to the tied assets.541\\nb) Purpose\\nThe repo transaction serves the purpose of obtaining short-term liquidity. Reverse repo is a \\nshort-term collateralized investment of surplus liquidity.542\\nc) Permitted transactions\\nRepurchase agreements are permitted under the following conditions: 543\\n\\u2022Framework agreement\\nThe insurance undertaking concludes the necessary framework agreements with the \\ncounterparty to the repurchase agreement (margin nos. 552-557).544\\n\\u2022Repo trading platform and settlement system\\nRepo transactions must be executed on an established repo trading platform that meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\n\\u2022central administration of the multilateral treaty system;\\n\\u2022simultaneous processing of the transaction;545\\n\\n### Section: Page 65\\n65/70\\u2022mapping of processes in real time;\\n\\u2022daily valuation (mark-to-market, at least once a day) of all open repo positions and\",\n          \"10/70acquisition of new business or business growth) sufficient assets are available to cover the \\ntarget amount of the tied assets.\\ne) Order\\nThe insurance company establishes the tied assets by allocating assets. It records and \\nidentifies these assets in such a way that it can prove at any time without delay which assets \\nbelong to the tied assets and that the target amount of each tied asset is covered (Art. 76 \\npara. 1 AVO).47\\nf) Criteria for the allocation of assets to restricted assets\\nAn asset can be allocated to restricted assets if: 48\\n\\u2022the investment is an admissible value in accordance with Art. 79 or Art. 68 para. 2 SO and \\nis eligible in accordance with this Circular. Partial crediting of investments (e.g. due to \\nnon-creditable parts or increased risks) is not permitted. Partial offsetting of the \\ninvestment is only possible if the exception is explicitly described in this circular (e.g. \\nmortgages, margin no. 312);49\\n\\u2022the investment can generally be valued without any problems; 50\\n\\u2022the investment has a high level of liquidity in relation to the corresponding investment \\ncategory;51\\n\\u2022the necessary expertise is available and appropriate processes and systems are applied \\nthat are necessary for the professional selection, management and control of the \\ninvestment made (margin no. 76);52\\n\\u2022The effects of the investment and its individual risk components are understood so that \\nthe financial, legal and operational risks can be assessed at all times;53\\n\\u2022the debtor's creditworthiness is verifiable (margin no. 139-152); 54\\n\\u2022the asset is neither encumbered nor can it be offset against third-party claims (margin no. 38). 55\\nThese principles are specified for each investment category in Chapters IV and V. 56\\nC. Investment strategy\\nThe Executive Board determines the investment strategy and submits it to the Board of Directors \\nfor approval (Art. 78 para. 1 let. a, Art. 101 SO).57\\nThe investment strategy takes appropriate account of the type and complexity of the business \\nconducted, in particular the insurance business (Art. 102 para. 1 SO).58\\n\\n### Section: Page 11\\n11/70The framework conditions for the use of the various investment categories must be defined in \\nthe investment strategy. All investments must be anchored in the investment strategy of the \\ncompany as a whole.59\\nThe limits of risk exposure must be set in accordance with the financial and organizational \\ncapacities of the insurance company.60\\nD. Investment regulations\\nThe investment regulations are issued by the Executive Board or a member of the Executive \\nBoard or the general representative and define the entire investment activity (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. b, Art. 106 para. 1 SO). The investment activity is comprehensively described in a \\ndocument, whereby specific references to other internal directives are possible.61\\nThe requirements for the investment regulations are based on the complexity of the investments \\nin the investment universe defined by the insurance company.62\\nThe insurance company regulates at least the following topics in the investment regulations: 63\\n\\u2022Internal investment principles and objectives (incl. ALM); 64\\n\\u2022Description of the investment universe (permitted investments / restrictions); 65\\n\\u2022Investment techniques and their area of application/purpose (e.g. use of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, securities lending, repurchase agreements);66\\n\\u2022Description of the investment process, monitoring and controls (definition of tasks, \\nresponsibilities, competencies, accountability and escalation mechanisms);67\\n\\u2022Staff requirements (e.g. specialist knowledge, experience, integrity). 68\\nE. Organization and control\\nThe administration (investment management) and control (risk management) of the \\ninvestment activity must be carried out by persons who are independent of each other and \\nmust be organizationally appropriate to the complexity of the business and investment activity \\n(Art. 78, 106 SO).69\\nThe staff must have adequate qualifications and knowledge of the asset classes invested in \\nand, in the case of investments in riskier investments, appropriate expertise (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. c, Art. 107 SO).70\\nThe systems used should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the investment portfolio, \\nbe monitored and have the necessary stability (Art. 106 para. 2 SO).71\\n\\n### Section: Page 12\\n12/70The administration (investment management) must ensure and perform at least the following \\ntasks:72\\n\\u2022the implementation of the investment strategy and the investment regulations; 73\\n\\u2022the definition and documentation of the strategic and tactical asset allocation, which is \\nadapted to the risk capacity, size and complexity of the insurance company, whereby the \\nallocation is made in relation to asset classes and other important characteristics such as \\nduration, sectors, creditworthiness and investment styles;74\\n\\u2022setting a limit system based on individual risk capacity, monitoring limits and defining \\nmeasures in the event of limit breaches;75\\n\\u2022the provision of an investment process that is commensurate with the complexity of the \\ninvestments. Scenario analyses must be used to ensure that the use of complex \\ninvestments does not jeopardize the value of the total assets and tied assets or the \\nsolvency of the insurance company;76\\n\\u2022monitoring the value of the assets; 77\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 78\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities;79\\n\\u2022the measurement and evaluation of investment results; 80\\n\\u2022the definition of internal reporting. 81\\nIf the insurance company commissions a third party with investment management, this does \\nnot relieve it of responsibility for compliance with the investment management regulations. In \\nparticular, the insurance company must understand the investment process, monitor the \\nspecified strategy and investment principles and be able to track all transactions in a timely \\nmanner for accounting purposes.82\\nThe transfer of investment management to third parties is subject to FINMA approval in \\naccordance with Art. 4 para. 2 let. j ISA.83\\nControl (risk management) must ensure and perform at least the following tasks: 84\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives in \\naccordance with margin no. 64 and the other internal directives of the insurance company;85\\n\\u2022monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 86\\n\\n### Section: Page 13\\n13/70\\u2022monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities.87\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 280,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes, derivatives used to hedge cash flows from underwriting obligations can be settled before maturity. The circumstances under which they can be settled before maturity include the necessity for internal reporting to justify the early closeout. Specifically, it is likely that the derivatives can be held until maturity as part of their hedging strategy. However, derivatives that are closed out before maturity must be justified in internal reporting. This means there must be a valid reason documented internally for the early settlement of these derivatives. Additionally, the use of these derivatives must be geared towards a sustainable effect and specifically, derivative contracts must not be concluded for the purpose of speculation.\",\n          \"The documentation specifies the handling of investment limits for unit-linked life insurance in relation to the tied assets by outlining that the tied assets must be determined based on the assets underlying the contracts. This means that the quantitative limits set forth in the document do not apply to the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance. Specifically, for life insurance linked to internal investment portfolios or other reference assets, only the limits of the Circular apply.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's highlighted that while the general rules about \\\"Exposure to a counterparty\\\" and \\\"Securities lending and repurchase agreements\\\" are to be observed, these limits may be exceeded if the policyholder has been expressly informed of the potential deviation from these limits before the contract is concluded. \\n\\nThis approach allows for flexibility in managing the investments linked to unit-linked life insurance policies, provided that there is clear communication with the policyholders about the investment limits and any possible deviations from standard limits. \\n\\nIn summary, while the broader investment principles and limits of the Circular must be respected, there is specific guidance for unit-linked life insurance tied assets that allows for certain exceptions, especially when policyholders are made aware of these exceptions in advance.\",\n          \"If the custodian bank is located abroad, specific regulations concerning safekeeping must be adhered to, as referenced in the text provided.

This often involves understanding and adhering to international finance regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, and any specific investment regulations of the home country.\\n\\n2. **Risk Management**: There must be effective risk management strategies in place to handle risks associated with foreign exchange transactions, jurisdictional legal risks, and the operational risks of dealing with foreign entities.\\n\\n3. **Operational Integrity**: The custodian bank should have robust systems for record-keeping, transaction processing, and ensuring the security of the assets under its care. This includes having adequate cybersecurity measures and physical security for safeguarding assets.\\n\\n4. **Information and Inspection Rights**: As outlined in the text, there's an obligation for the fund management company, the custodian bank, and other service providers to provide information in accordance with Art. 29 FINMASA and allow FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) to conduct on-site inspections. This ensures that there's transparency and accountability in the operations of the custodian bank, especially concerning its safekeeping practices.\\n\\n5. **Contractual Agreements**: It is contractually agreed upon that these entities have a duty to provide information to FINMA as per Art. 29 FINMASA and to permit on-site inspections by FINMA at the respective service providers' locations.\\n\\nWhile specific regulations (margin nos. 156 and 157) were mentioned, the overarching principle is that custodian banks, especially those located abroad, must operate in a manner that ensures the protection and proper management of the assets they are entrusted with, while also facilitating regulatory oversight and compliance with relevant local and international laws.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Answer this question: What are the primary investment principles for total assets? [/INST] 1. **Security**: The primary investment principle for total assets is security. This means that the investments should be safe and secure, with a low risk of loss. The focus is on preserving the value of the assets, especially in the context of the insurance company's obligations to policyholders.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Liquidity**: Another key principle is liquidity. This means that the investments should be easily convertible into cash without significant loss in value. Liquidity is crucial because it allows the insurance company to meet its obligations to policyholders promptly and efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Profitability**: While security and liquidity are paramount, profitability is also a consideration. The investments should generate a return that is sufficient to meet the company's financial needs and support its growth. However, this should be balanced against the need for security and liquidity.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Diversification**: The principle of diversification is also important. This means spreading the investments across different asset classes, geographical regions, and sectors to reduce risk. Diversification helps to mitigate the impact of any losses in a single investment by spreading the risk across multiple investments.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The investments must comply with regulatory requirements. This includes adhering to the guidelines set by the regulatory body for the insurance industry, such as the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Compliance ensures that the investments are transparent, ethical, and in line with the broader regulatory framework governing the insurance sector.\n",

Answer this question: What are the rules for investment in cash deposits? [/INST] 1. **Investment in Cash Deposits:** The rules for investment in cash deposits are outlined in the document under the section \"Investment in Cash Deposits.\" These rules are designed to ensure that the investment in cash deposits is secure, liquid, and provides a stable return.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Security:** The security of the investment is paramount. Cash deposits are considered to be among the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing bank. This means that the bank guarantees the return of the principal amount of the deposit, along with the interest earned, up to a certain limit.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Liquidity:** Liquidity is another important consideration. Cash deposits are highly liquid, meaning they can be easily converted into cash without significant loss in value. This makes them an attractive investment for those who need quick access to their funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Stable Return:** Cash deposits provide a stable return. The interest rate on a cash deposit is typically fixed for the term of the deposit. This means that the investor knows exactly what return they will receive over the term of the deposit.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Term:** The term of a cash deposit can vary from short-term (as short as a few days) to long-term (up to several years). The term chosen depends on the investor's needs and risk tolerance.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Interest Rates:** The interest rate on a cash deposit is determined by the market conditions and the creditworthiness of the issuing bank. Generally, longer-term deposits offer higher interest rates than shorter-term deposits.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Risk:** While cash deposits are considered safe, they do carry some risk. The most significant risk is the risk of inflation. If the rate of inflation is higher than the interest rate on the deposit, the value of the money in the deposit will decrease over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Regulation:** Cash deposits are subject to regulatory oversight. This ensures that the banks that issue cash deposits are financially stable and that the deposits are secure.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Insurance:** In many countries, cash deposits are insured up to a certain amount. This means that if the issuing bank fails, the depositor is guaranteed to receive a certain amount of their money back.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Taxation:** Cash deposits are subject to taxation. The tax treatment of cash deposits depends on the tax laws of the jurisdiction in which the deposit is held.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the rules for investment in cash deposits emphasize security, liquidity, and stable returns. They also acknowledge the risks associated with cash deposits, particularly the risk of inflation, and the importance of regulatory oversight and insurance to protect investors.\n"

Answer this question: What are high-risk investments for insurance companies? [/INST] 1. High-risk investments for insurance companies are those that carry a higher level of uncertainty regarding their return or the risk of loss. These investments are typically characterized by their volatility, which can result in significant gains or losses. Examples of high-risk investments include:\n",
            "\n",
            "   - Equities: Stocks of companies, which can be influenced by market conditions, economic factors, and company-specific risks.\n",
            "   - Bonds with lower credit ratings: These bonds are issued by companies or governments with a higher risk of default, meaning there is a greater chance of not receiving the full amount of the investment back.\n",
            "   - Derivatives: These are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset. They can be complex and carry a higher risk due to their sensitivity to market conditions and the potential for leverage.\n",
            "   - Private equity and private debt: These are investments in private companies or projects, which can be less liquid and more difficult to value than publicly traded securities.\n",
            "   - Real estate: While real estate can provide stable returns over the long term, it can also be subject to market fluctuations, property-specific risks, and the need for significant capital for maintenance and renovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Insurance companies are required to manage their investments in a way that balances risk and return, ensuring that they can meet their obligations to policyholders. High-risk investments can provide higher returns, but they also carry a higher risk of loss. Therefore, insurance companies must have a well-defined investment strategy that aligns with their risk tolerance and liquidity needs. This strategy should include a clear understanding of the risks associated with each investment and how those risks can be managed.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The regulatory framework for insurance companies, as outlined in the text, emphasizes the need for a prudent investment approach. This means that insurance companies must prioritize the safety and liquidity of their investments over the pursuit of higher returns. High-risk investments are generally discouraged unless they are part of a diversified portfolio and are aligned with the company's risk management strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. The text also highlights the importance of stress testing investments to assess their performance under adverse market conditions. This is particularly important for high-risk investments, as they are more likely to be affected by market volatility and economic downturns. Stress testing can help insurance companies understand the potential impact of these investments on their financial stability and their ability to meet their obligations to policyholders.\n",

Answer this question: How are investments in high-risk assets regulated? [/INST] 1. Investments in high-risk assets are regulated through a set of guidelines and requirements that aim to ensure the safety and stability of the investment portfolio. These regulations are designed to protect the interests of the investors by limiting their exposure to high-risk assets that could potentially result in significant losses.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The primary regulation governing investments in high-risk assets is the requirement for these assets to be allocated within the tied assets of an insurance company. Tied assets are those assets that are specifically designated to be held by an insurance company to meet its obligations to policyholders. By requiring high-risk assets to be included within tied assets, regulators are ensuring that these assets are subject to the same level of scrutiny and oversight as other assets that are critical to the financial stability of the insurance company.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The allocation of high-risk assets within tied assets is subject to specific limits and conditions. For example, the total allocation to high-risk assets cannot exceed 10% of the target amount of the tied assets. This limit is designed to prevent insurance companies from overexposing themselves to high-risk assets, which could increase the likelihood of significant losses.\n",

The regulations governing investments in high-risk assets also require that these assets be allocated in a manner that is consistent with the overall investment strategy of the insurance company. This means that the allocation of high-risk assets should be in line with the company's risk tolerance, investment objectives, and financial capacity.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. The regulations further require that the insurance company has the necessary expertise and resources to manage the risks associated with high-risk assets. This includes having a well-defined investment strategy, a robust risk management system, and adequate staff and infrastructure to support the investment process.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. The regulations also require that the insurance company has a clear understanding of the risks associated with high-risk assets and that it has implemented appropriate measures to mitigate these risks. This could include diversifying the investment portfolio, using derivatives to hedge against market risks, or implementing a risk management system that can monitor and respond to changes in market conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Finally, the regulations require that the insurance company has a comprehensive investment management system in place, which includes procedures for the selection, execution, and monitoring of investments. This system should be designed to ensure that the investment process is transparent, accountable, and aligned with the company's investment objectives and risk tolerance.\n",
            "\n",

Answer this question: What is the principle of diversification within tied assets? [/INST] 1. The principle of diversification within tied assets is a fundamental concept that emphasizes the importance of spreading investments across various asset classes, geographical regions, and issuers to mitigate risk and enhance the overall stability and performance of the investment portfolio. This principle is crucial for tied assets, which are specifically designated to secure the claims of policyholders in the event of the insurance company's bankruptcy. By diversifying the investments, the risk associated with any single investment is reduced, thereby increasing the overall stability and resilience of the tied assets portfolio. This diversification strategy is designed to protect against the risk of loss from any single investment, ensuring that the tied assets are able to meet their obligations to policyholders even in adverse market conditions. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. The diversification principle is particularly important for tied assets because it helps to manage the risks associated with the insurance company's business operations. For instance, if the insurance company's business is concentrated in a particular region or sector that is prone to economic downturns or natural disasters, the diversification of tied assets can help to mitigate the impact of these risks on the company's ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Similarly, if the insurance company's investment portfolio is heavily weighted towards a single asset class or issuer, the diversification of tied assets can help to reduce the risk of loss from market fluctuations or credit risk. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. The principle of diversification is also aligned with the broader investment principles of risk management and return optimization. By spreading investments across various asset classes and issuers, the insurance company can aim to achieve a balance between risk and return, seeking to maximize returns while minimizing the risk of loss. This approach can help to ensure that the tied assets are able to generate sufficient returns to meet the company's obligations to policyholders over the long term, while also protecting against the risk of loss from market volatility or other adverse conditions. \n",
            "\n",
            "4. The principle of diversification is a key component of the regulatory framework governing tied assets. For instance, the AVO (Ordinance on the Supervision of Banks) and the ISA (Insurance Supervision Act) both emphasize the importance of diversification in the management of tied assets. These regulations require insurance companies to ensure that their tied assets are diversified in a manner that is appropriate for the company's risk profile and investment objectives. This requirement is designed to ensure that the tied assets are able to meet their obligations to policyholders in a stable and sustainable manner, even in the face of market volatility or other adverse conditions. \n",
            "\n",
            "5. The principle of diversification is also reflected in the specific investment guidelines that are issued by regulatory authorities for tied assets. For instance, the Circular 16/5 \"Investment Guidelines - Tied Assets\" issued by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) emphasizes the importance of diversification in the management of tied assets. The circular requires insurance companies to ensure that their tied assets are diversified across various asset classes, geographical regions, and issuers, in a manner that is appropriate for the company's risk profile and investment objectives. This requirement is designed to ensure that the tied assets are able to meet their obligations to policyholders in a stable and sustainable manner, even in the face of market volatility or other adverse conditions. \n",

Answer this question: What limits are set for investments in equities and equity securities? [/INST] 1. The limits set for investments in equities and equity securities are as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "   - The total amount of investments in equities and equity securities may not exceed 30% of the target amount of the tied assets.\n",
            "   - The investment in a single equity security may not exceed 5% of the target amount of the tied assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. These limits are designed to manage risk and ensure that the investments are diversified, thereby reducing the overall volatility of the tied assets. By limiting the exposure to any single equity security, the risk of significant losses due to the performance of that security is mitigated. Similarly, the overall exposure to equities is capped to prevent excessive risk-taking that could jeopardize the stability of the tied assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. These limits are in line with the general principles of risk management and diversification, which are crucial for the prudent management of tied assets. They reflect the need to balance the potential for higher returns from equity investments against the risk of losses, ensuring that the investments are aligned with the financial stability and the regulatory requirements for tied assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. It is important to note that these limits are not absolute and can be exceeded under certain conditions, such as when the investment is part of a diversified portfolio that is expected to reduce overall risk. However, even in such cases, the investment must be carefully considered and justified to ensure that it does not unduly increase the risk profile of the tied assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. The limits are also subject to review and adjustment by the insurance company, taking into account the specific circumstances of its investment strategy and the market conditions. This flexibility allows for a more nuanced approach to investment management, but it also requires a high level of expertise and risk management skills on the part of the insurance company.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. In summary, the limits set for investments in equities and equity securities are designed to ensure that the investments are managed prudently, with a focus on risk management and diversification. They reflect the need to balance the potential for higher returns with the risk of losses, and they provide a framework for the insurance company to make informed investment decisions that are consistent with its regulatory obligations and its risk management objectives.\n"

            "3. By requiring that the real estate be easily realizable, easily valued, easily divisible, easily transferable, easily encumbered, easily leased, easily managed, easily insured, easily maintained, easily financed, easily rented, and easily sold, the limitations ensure that the real estate investment is a good fit for the tied assets, which are intended to be readily available to meet the insurance company's obligations.\n",

Answer this question:  What are synthetic bonds and how are they used? [/INST] 1. Synthetic bonds are a type of financial instrument that is created by combining a bond and a derivative. The derivative used is typically a swap, which allows the holder of the synthetic bond to receive the interest payments of the underlying bond, while also having the option to receive the bond's principal at maturity. This combination of a bond and a swap creates a synthetic bond that can be tailored to specific investment needs, such as interest rate risk management or yield enhancement.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Synthetic bonds are used for various purposes in financial markets. One of the primary uses is for the management of interest rate risk. By combining a bond with a swap, investors can create a synthetic bond that is less sensitive to changes in interest rates. This can be particularly useful for investors who are concerned about the impact of rising interest rates on the value of their bond investments.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Another use of synthetic bonds is for the enhancement of yield. By combining a bond with a swap, investors can create a synthetic bond that has a higher yield than the underlying bond. This can be achieved by structuring the swap in a way that increases the cash flows received by the investor.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Synthetic bonds can also be used to create exposure to specific credit risks or to gain access to certain markets that may not be directly accessible through traditional bond investments. For example, a synthetic bond could be used to create exposure to the credit risk of a particular company, even if that company does not issue bonds directly.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. It is important to note that synthetic bonds, like all financial instruments, carry risks. These risks can include the risk of the counterparty to the swap failing to meet its obligations, the risk of changes in interest rates or credit spreads affecting the value of the synthetic bond, and the risk of liquidity issues if the synthetic bond is not easily tradable in the market.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Synthetic bonds are typically traded over-the-counter (OTC), meaning that they are not listed on a regulated exchange and are instead traded directly between two parties. This lack of standardization and transparency can make synthetic bonds more complex and riskier to invest in than traditional bonds.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Synthetic bonds are also subject to regulatory oversight, particularly in the context of the derivatives used to create them. Regulatory bodies such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States have established rules and guidelines for the trading and reporting of derivatives, including synthetic bonds. These rules are designed to ensure that the use of derivatives is transparent, fair, and does not pose undue risk to the financial system or to individual investors.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. In summary, synthetic bonds are a type of financial instrument that is created by combining a bond and a derivative, typically a swap. They are used for various purposes, including the management of interest rate risk, the enhancement of yield, and the creation of exposure to specific credit risks or markets. Synthetic bonds carry risks, particularly in the context of the derivatives used to create them, and are subject to regulatory oversight.\n"

            "   - **Understanding the Role of Derivatives:** Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset. They can be used to hedge against market risks, speculate on price movements, or to gain exposure to assets that might be difficult to acquire directly.\n",
            "   - **Maintaining Liquidity:** Liquidity is the ability to convert assets into cash quickly and without significant loss in value. When using derivatives in investment strategies, it is crucial to maintain liquidity to ensure that the investments can be liquidated promptly if necessary. This is particularly important in volatile markets where the value of derivatives can change rapidly.\n",

Answer this question: How are mortgage receivables treated under the tied assets regulations? [/INST] 1. Mortgage receivables are treated under the tied assets regulations as a form of real estate. Specifically, they are categorized under the \"real estate\" section of the tied assets, which is outlined in margin no. 398 of the source document. This categorization is based on the nature of the mortgage receivables, which are essentially loans secured by a mortgage on real estate.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The treatment of mortgage receivables as real estate under the tied assets regulations is significant because it means that these assets are subject to the same regulatory requirements and standards as other real estate assets. This includes requirements related to the valuation, liquidity, and risk management of the assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The inclusion of mortgage receivables under the real estate category of tied assets is also important because it ensures that these assets are included in the overall regulatory framework governing the management and investment of tied assets. This framework is designed to ensure the safety, liquidity, and profitability of tied assets, which are assets that are held by insurance companies to back up their insurance obligations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. The specific regulatory requirements that apply to mortgage receivables as real estate under the tied assets regulations are not explicitly stated in the source document. However, it can be inferred that these requirements would be similar to those that apply to other real estate assets, such as the need for proper valuation, the requirement for liquidity to meet insurance claims, and the need for risk management to ensure that the assets are not unduly exposed to market or credit risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. The treatment of mortgage receivables as real estate under the tied assets regulations is consistent with their nature as loans secured by a mortgage on real estate. This means that the value and liquidity of these assets are closely tied to the underlying real estate, and that the risks associated with these assets are similar to those associated with other real estate investments.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. The inclusion of mortgage receivables under the real estate category of tied assets also reflects the fact that these assets are often used as a form of collateral or security for other financial transactions. This is because the mortgage on the underlying real estate gives the lender a legal claim to the property in the event of default on the loan.\n",

Overall, the treatment of mortgage receivables as real estate under the tied assets regulations is a recognition of the unique characteristics and risks associated with these assets, and a reflection of the regulatory framework's aim to ensure that tied assets are managed in a way that is safe, liquid, and profitable for insurance companies and their policyholders.\n"

Answer this question: How do regulations ensure that the claims of the insured are prioritized in the event of an insurer's insolvency? [/INST] 1. **Prioritization of Claims in Insolvency:** Regulations ensure that the claims of the insured are prioritized in the event of an insurer's insolvency by establishing a hierarchy of claims. This hierarchy is designed to ensure that the claims of policyholders are given priority over other claims, such as those of creditors or other claimants. This prioritization is crucial because it ensures that the insured individuals receive the compensation they are entitled to under their insurance policies, even if the insurer is unable to meet its financial obligations due to insolvency.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Protection of Policyholder Interests:** The regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders, who are typically the most vulnerable in the event of an insurer's insolvency. By prioritizing their claims, the regulations ensure that policyholders are not left without compensation when the insurer is unable to pay. This protection is particularly important for policyholders who have purchased insurance to cover significant financial risks, such as the loss of their home or business, or the risk of serious illness or death.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Role of the Regulator:** The regulatory body responsible for overseeing the insurance industry plays a crucial role in ensuring that the claims of the insured are prioritized in the event of an insurer's insolvency. This involves setting up a system for the orderly resolution of insolvencies, which includes the establishment of a priority order for claims. The regulator also has the power to intervene in the event of an insolvency to ensure that the claims of policyholders are given priority.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Insolvency Proceedings:** In the event of an insurer's insolvency, the regulatory body will oversee the insolvency proceedings. This involves the appointment of a liquidator or receiver, who will be responsible for managing the insurer's assets and distributing them to creditors and policyholders in accordance with the priority order established by the regulations. The insolvency proceedings will be conducted in a manner that ensures that the claims of policyholders are given priority, in line with the regulatory framework designed to protect their interests.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Protection of Policyholder Assets:** The regulations also provide for the protection of policyholder assets, which are typically held by the insurer on behalf of the policyholders. In the event of an insurer's insolvency, these assets are typically segregated and held separately from the insurer's other assets. This segregation ensures that they are not used to pay other claims, and are instead reserved for the payment of policyholder claims in accordance with the priority order established by the regulations.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, regulations ensure that the claims of the insured are prioritized in the event of an insurer's insolvency by establishing a priority order for claims, protecting policyholder interests, and overseeing the insolvency proceedings to ensure that policyholder claims are given priority. This system is designed to provide a safety net for policyholders, ensuring that they receive the compensation they are entitled to even if the insurer is unable to pay due to insolvency.\n"

            "\n",
            "   - If the insurance company fails to meet the requirements of the tied assets, it is subject to a fine of up to 10% of the target amount of the tied assets.\n",

The penalties are also a reflection of the regulatory emphasis on ensuring the stability and security of the insurance sector, which is critical for maintaining financial stability and protecting the interests of policyholders. By imposing penalties for non-compliance with the tied asset regulations, regulators are able to incentivize insurance companies to prioritize the requirements of the tied assets, thereby reducing the risk of insolvency and ensuring that policyholders' claims are secure.\n",

            "6. The penalties are not intended to be punitive in nature, but rather to serve as a deterrent to non-compliance and a means of ensuring that insurance companies are meeting their regulatory obligations in relation to the tied assets. They are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the non-compliance, reflecting the need for a balanced approach that encourages compliance while also providing a mechanism for addressing non-compliance when it occurs.\n",

            "<s>[INST] You are a helpful assistant. Make direct answers with good explanations. Do not lie and if you do not know the answer, say you do not know. Answer this question: Describe the process for the annual evaluation of the insurance company's overall investment portfolio including tied assets. [/INST] 1. **Annual Evaluation Process**: The annual evaluation of the insurance company's overall investment portfolio, including tied assets, is a crucial process that involves several key steps. These steps are designed to ensure the ongoing health and compliance of the investment portfolio with regulatory requirements and the company's investment policies.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Involvement of the Investment Management Department**: The process begins with the involvement of the investment management department. This department is responsible for the day-to-day management of the insurance company's investment portfolio. They are tasked with ensuring that the portfolio is aligned with the company's investment objectives, risk tolerance, and regulatory requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Assessment of Investment Strategy**: The first step in the annual evaluation process is the assessment of the investment strategy. This involves reviewing the company's investment objectives, risk tolerance, and the overall investment strategy to ensure it is still appropriate and effective. This assessment is crucial because it sets the direction for the rest of the evaluation process.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Review of Investment Management Practices**: The next step is the review of investment management practices. This involves examining the processes and procedures used by the investment management department to manage the portfolio. This review ensures that the department is following best practices and that its processes are efficient and effective.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Evaluation of Investment Portfolio**: The third step is the evaluation of the investment portfolio itself. This involves a detailed analysis of the individual investments in the portfolio to ensure they are performing as expected and are aligned with the company's investment objectives and risk tolerance. This analysis also includes a review of the portfolio's diversification and liquidity.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Assessment of Investment Processes**: The fourth step is the assessment of the investment processes. This involves reviewing the processes used to select, manage, and monitor the investments in the portfolio. This assessment ensures that the processes are effective and that they are being followed consistently.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Identification and Management of Risks**: The fifth step is the identification and management of risks. This involves assessing the risks associated with the investments in the portfolio and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. This step is crucial because it helps to protect the portfolio from potential losses.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Documentation and Reporting**: The final step is the documentation and reporting of the evaluation process. This involves documenting the findings of the evaluation process and reporting them to the relevant stakeholders, including the board of directors and regulatory authorities. This documentation and reporting ensure that the evaluation process is transparent and that stakeholders are informed about the status of the investment portfolio.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Continuous Improvement**: The annual evaluation process is not a one-time event but rather a continuous process. The findings from the evaluation are used to identify areas for improvement and to develop strategies to enhance the performance and compliance of the investment portfolio. This continuous improvement approach ensures that the investment portfolio remains aligned with the company's objectives and regulatory requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the annual evaluation of the insurance company's overall investment portfolio, including tied assets, is a comprehensive process that involves the assessment of the investment strategy, the review of investment management practices, the evaluation of the investment portfolio, the assessment of investment processes, the identification and management of risks, and the documentation and reporting of the evaluation process. This process is designed to ensure the ongoing health and compliance of the investment portfolio with regulatory requirements and the company's investment policies.\n"

Chapters IV and V explain the requirements for the \\npermissible assets in tied assets (Art. 79 of the Supervision Ordinance [SO; SR 961.011]).1\\nII General principles for total assets\\nA. Investment principles\\nWhen selecting its investments, the insurance company takes into account the structure and \\ndevelopment of the obligations (asset liability management, ALM), the security of the \\ninvestments, appropriate diversification and the insurance company's foreseeable need for \\nliquid assets.2\\nB. Derivative financial instruments\\na) Use of derivative financial instruments\\nInsurance companies may only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risks on the \\ninvestments or on their obligations to the insured persons or to manage the investments \\nefficiently (Art. 100 SO).3\\nWhen using derivatives, the insurance company may not take any risks that are inappropriate \\nto the scope of business and risk capacity of the insurance company. The use of derivatives \\nshould also be aimed at achieving a sustainable effect.4\\nb) Obligation to provide cover when using derivatives\\nIn accordance with Art. 100 para. 2 SO, all obligations that may arise from derivative financial \\ntransactions must be covered. The obligations must be covered at all times and in full \\n(contract volume / notional value) either by the underlying assets on which the derivatives are \\nbased (in the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell) or by liquidity (in the case of \\nderivatives with an obligation to buy).5\\nLiquidity can include both cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents\\nCash deposits in accordance with margin nos. 181-185 and government bonds with a minimum \\ncredit rating of 2 and very good liquidity are considered funds. In addition, the funds mentioned in \\nmargin no. 1146\\n\\n### Section: Page 4\\n4/70Receivables that are exempt from the counterparty limit are regarded as cash equivalents.\\nThe obligation is covered at all times and in full if: 7\\n•the liquidity or cash equivalents are available; 8\\n•the underlying assets are held by the insurance company and are available without \\nrestriction - securities lending in relation to the underlying assets and repurchase \\nagreements (repo, reverse repo) in connection with derivative transactions are not \\npermitted. Lent securities are an exception if the short-term recall of these securities is \\npossible without restriction. The increased operational risks arising from these \\ntransactions must be taken into account;9\\n•double use of liquidity or underlying assets to cover several transactions is excluded - \\nunderlying assets or liquidity can be used simultaneously to cover derivative positions if \\nthese involve several risks (e.g. a market, credit or currency risk) but relate to the same \\nunderlying assets;10\\n•the market value of the cash equivalents or the number of underlying assets covers the \\nentire obligation, whereby cash equivalents - with the exception of cash deposits in \\naccordance with margin nos. 181-185 - may only be used as cover to the extent of 90% of \\nthe market value.11\\nIn the case of derivatives with a purchase or acceptance obligation (e.g. long futures, long \\nforwards, short puts) of an underlying asset, such as a share, a financial index, a currency or \\nan interest rate, the liquidity required to fulfill the obligation must be available at all times.12\\nIn the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell or deliver (e.g. short futures, short forwards, \\nshort calls) an underlying asset, such as a share, a currency or an interest rate, the underlying \\ninvestment must be available at all times and without restriction to fulfill the obligation. In the \\ncase of index derivatives, the obligations are deemed to be covered if there is an extensive \\nand stable correlation between the underlying assets held and the index.13\\nIf there is a contractual right to satisfy an obligation entered into by means of a cash payment \\ninstead of delivery of the deliverable underlying, the physically deliverable underlying must \\nnevertheless be held.14\\nIf cash settlement is mandatory for underlyings that cannot be physically delivered (e.g. \\nunderlyings for weather derivatives), the necessary liquidity must be maintained in full at all \\ntimes in the event of an obligation to sell such derivatives.15\\nIn the case of derivatives with an obligation to exchange cash flows (e.g. interest rate swaps), \\nthe cash flow to be paid must be ensured with the necessary liquidity or underlying.\\nbecome.16\\n\\n### Section: Page 5\\n5/70In the case of combinations of derivatives, the obligations of the entire combination for the \\nfulfillment of the obligations must be covered at all times by underlying assets or liquidity \\navailable in the assets. The underlyings of the combinations must be identical to the \\nunderlyings used as cover.17\\nc) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance undertakings that use derivative financial instruments must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (margin no. 76).18\\nThe provisions of margin nos. 57-87 m u s t  also be observed mutatis mutandis when using \\nderivative financial instruments.19\\nd) Analysis of the risks associated with the use of derivative financial instruments\\nThe counterparty risks resulting from derivative transactions must be taken into account \\nbefore derivative financial instruments are used. The risks must be analyzed as often as the \\nsituation requires, but at least once a week for market risks and once a month for credit risks. \\nThe analysis of market and credit risks consists, among other things, of evaluating the open \\npositions and comparing them with the defined limits of risk exposure. The result of the risk \\nanalysis must be presented to the Executive Board as often as the situation requires, but at \\nleast once a month for market risks and at least once every three months for credit risks (Art. \\n104 SO).20\\nThe insurance company's risk management ensures that the derivative strategies of different \\ndivisions are recorded centrally and analyzed for interdependencies. To this end, various \\nrelevant scenario calculations must be carried out to ensure that the overall use of derivatives \\ndoes not jeopardize the value of the assets or the solvency of the company. The insurance \\ncompany ensures that the economic impact on assets and solvency in connection with \\nderivative transactions is correctly shown in the various reports to FINMA.21\\nAccording to Art. 108 SO, an activity report on the use of derivative financial instruments must \\nbe submitted to the Board of Directors at least every six months.22\\nIII General principles for tied assets\\nA.

The tied assets \\nprovide the insured persons with a liability substrate that ensures that their claims are satisfied \\nwith priority over other creditors in the event of the insurance company's bankruptcy.\\nThe assets allocated to the tied assets must be secure, unencumbered property of the \\ninsurance company and realizable in the event of the bankruptcy of the insurance company in \\nSwitzerland. To ensure that the claims of the insured persons are effectively secured, \\nattention must be paid to the intrinsic value and stability of value when allocating assets to tied \\nassets.24\\nB. Principles\\na) Investment principles\\naa) Security\\nThe investments in tied assets must be selected in such a way that the claims arising from \\ninsurance contracts can be met at all times.25\\nThe security of investments is guaranteed if they are economically and legally secure. \\nEconomic security is understood to mean the preservation of the value of the capital or \\nassets; the legal security of the investments is measured by their availability and saleability. \\nThe requirement of economic and legal security applies to both direct and indirect \\ninvestments.26\\nThe following criteria in particular must be observed with regard to maintaining the value of \\nassets:\\n•the fluctuation in value of the total tied assets, whereby the extent of the fluctuation in \\nvalue that can be tolerated depends on the level of overfunding of the tied assets;\\n•the quality of the system;\\n•a reliable valuation method for the system.27\\nThe legal security of the system relates in particular to the following criteria:\\n•unrestricted power of disposal;\\n•the unrestricted saleability and transferability of the assets, in particular in the event of the \\ninsurance company's bankruptcy.28\\nAssets that jeopardize the intrinsic value of the tied assets (e.g. assets that give rise to additional \\nfunding obligations at the expense of the tied assets) are not permitted.\\nassets).29\\n\\n### Section: Page 8\\n8/70bb) Orientation towards obligations (Asset Liability Management, ALM)\\nThe order of the tied assets must be based on the structure and expected development of the \\ninsurance obligations to be secured. Appropriate account must be taken of both the \\nperformance of investments and liabilities and the expected cash flows from investments and \\nobligations.30\\ncc) Profitability\\nThe insurance company selects investments that generate a return in line with the market. 31\\ndd) Diversification\\nEach tied asset must be sufficiently and appropriately diversified. Cluster risks must be \\nexcluded. An appropriate mix in relation to the various investment categories and a spread of \\ninvestments in relation to the debtors of the assets must be achieved.32\\nAn appropriate mix of investments with regard to the various investment categories takes into \\naccount the following criteria in particular:\\n•the specific risk profile and default risk or impairment risk of the investments;\\n•the investment horizon (i.e. investment period) of the investment;\\n•the correlation of asset classes.33\\nAn appropriate diversification of investments takes into account at least the following criteria:\\n•various counterparties;\\n•different geographical regions;\\n•different industries and segments.34\\nInvestments in high-risk investments may only be made as a cautious addition to and \\nappropriate diversification of the total tied assets. The risk capacity of the insurance company \\nmust always be taken into account. Investments in securities with a credit rating of 5 are only \\npermitted if there is corresponding technical expertise in the area of credit risks.35\\nee) Liquidity\\nIn principle, the insurance company must choose investments that can be realized quickly if \\nnecessary, especially in the event of the insurance company's bankruptcy.36\\nThe realizability of an investment depends, among other things, on the term of an investment \\n(e.g. bonds, fixed-term deposits) or the possibility of assigning (selling) the investment on the \\nmarket or on a stock exchange.37\\n\\n### Section: Page 9\\n9/70b) Prohibition of charging and offsetting\\nThe value of the tied assets must be unencumbered (Art. 84 para. 2 SO). In principle, the tied \\nassets may not be encumbered by liens, rights of retention, rights of set-off or similar rights. \\nNo additional funding obligations may be created to the detriment of the tied assets. \\nExceptions are set out in Chapters IV and V.38\\nc) Realization in bankruptcy\\nThe assets in tied assets serve solely to secure claims arising from insurance contracts in the \\nevent of the insolvency and liquidation of the insurance company under bankruptcy law. It \\nmust therefore be ensured that the assets flow into the bankruptcy estate and can be \\nliquidated in Swiss bankruptcy proceedings.39\\nThe recoverability in bankruptcy must be ensured by the insurance company, whereby proof can \\nbe provided as follows:40\\n•The investment is securitized and traded on a market so that a market price can be \\ndetermined; or41\\n•the legal system applicable to the investment recognizes FINMA's insolvency proceedings \\nand the priority privilege of tied assets under Swiss law, so that special executions or \\nother interventions by an authority or third parties are not possible.42\\nAt FINMA's request, the possibility of realizability in Swiss bankruptcy must be demonstrated. 43\\nd) Obligation to provide cover at all times\\nThe insurance company shall take suitable organizational measures to ensure that the current \\ndebit amount pursuant to Art. 56 and 57 or 68 SO is covered at all times by permissible assets \\npursuant to Art. 68 para. 2, 79 and 81 SO. The amount of the current target amount is \\ndetermined on the basis of the current provisions if a statement of account were prepared at \\nthat time.44\\nInstead of a concrete calculation of the current provisions, well-founded and prudent estimates \\ncan also be used during the year, provided that it can be demonstrated with a high degree of \\ncertainty that the current target amount is actually covered by the calculated values.45\\nThis ensures that even after events and developments occurring during the year that require \\nfurther technical provisions and require a\\nhave an influence on the target amount (e.g. unexpected claims, need for additional reserves),46\\n\\n### Section: Page 10\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It records and \\nidentifies these assets in such a way that it can prove at any time without delay which assets \\nbelong to the tied assets and that the target amount of each tied asset is covered (Art. 76 \\npara. 1 AVO).47\\nf) Criteria for the allocation of assets to restricted assets\\nAn asset can be allocated to restricted assets if: 48\\n•the investment is an admissible value in accordance with Art. 79 or Art. 68 para. 2 SO and \\nis eligible in accordance with this Circular. Partial crediting of investments (e.g. due to \\nnon-creditable parts or increased risks) is not permitted. Partial offsetting of the \\ninvestment is only possible if the exception is explicitly described in this circular (e.g. \\nmortgages, margin no. 312);49\\n•the investment can generally be valued without any problems; 50\\n•the investment has a high level of liquidity in relation to the corresponding investment \\ncategory;51\\n•the necessary expertise is available and appropriate processes and systems are applied \\nthat are necessary for the professional selection, management and control of the \\ninvestment made (margin no. 76);52\\n•The effects of the investment and its individual risk components are understood so that \\nthe financial, legal and operational risks can be assessed at all times;53\\n•the debtor's creditworthiness is verifiable (margin no. 139-152); 54\\n•the asset is neither encumbered nor can it be offset against third-party claims (margin no. 38). 55\\nThese principles are specified for each investment category in Chapters IV and V. 56\\nC. Investment strategy\\nThe Executive Board determines the investment strategy and submits it to the Board of Directors \\nfor approval (Art. 78 para. 1 let. a, Art. 101 SO).57\\nThe investment strategy takes appropriate account of the type and complexity of the business \\nconducted, in particular the insurance business (Art. 102 para. 1 SO).58\\n\\n### Section: Page 11\\n11/70The framework conditions for the use of the various investment categories must be defined in \\nthe investment strategy. All investments must be anchored in the investment strategy of the \\ncompany as a whole.59\\nThe limits of risk exposure must be set in accordance with the financial and organizational \\ncapacities of the insurance company.60\\nD. Investment regulations\\nThe investment regulations are issued by the Executive Board or a member of the Executive \\nBoard or the general representative and define the entire investment activity (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. b, Art. 106 para. 1 SO). The investment activity is comprehensively described in a \\ndocument, whereby specific references to other internal directives are possible.61\\nThe requirements for the investment regulations are based on the complexity of the investments \\nin the investment universe defined by the insurance company.62\\nThe insurance company regulates at least the following topics in the investment regulations: 63\\n•Internal investment principles and objectives (incl. ALM); 64\\n•Description of the investment universe (permitted investments / restrictions); 65\\n•Investment techniques and their area of application/purpose (e.g. use of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, securities lending, repurchase agreements);66\\n•Description of the investment process, monitoring and controls (definition of tasks, \\nresponsibilities, competencies, accountability and escalation mechanisms);67\\n•Staff requirements (e.g. specialist knowledge, experience, integrity). 68\\nE.

Further provisions\\na) Separate tied assets\\nSeparate tied assets are to be ordered for (Art. 77 para. 1 AVO):\\n•occupational pension insurance;\\n•the policyholder claims from unit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions \\n(insurance classes A2.1, A2.2, A2.3 and A6.1);\\n•the policyholder claims from insurance contracts or capitalization transactions that are \\nlinked to internal investment portfolios or other reference values (insurance sections A2.4, \\nA2.5, A2.6 and A6.2).\\nThe appointment of further tied assets is possible (Art. 77 para. 2 SO) and may be ordered by \\nFINMA in justified cases (para. 3).88\\nIn Art. 77 para. 1 let. b and c AVO, reference is no longer made to the savings portion of the \\ninsurance contracts, but to the entire insured persons' claims. In particular, this is intended to \\navoid the previously separate safeguarding of the savings and guarantee components.89\\nThis Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined \\nlimits, the coverage obligations and the qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be \\ntaken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization \\ntransactions (insurance classes A2.1-A2.6 as well as A6.1 and A6.2), however, exceptions \\napply with regard to the limits (see margin no. 122).90\\nb) Foreign insurance portfolio\\nThe insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied \\nassets if equivalent security must be provided abroad (Art. 17 para. 2 ISA). If no equivalent \\nsecurity has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the \\nprovision can be made in separate tied assets (Art. 77 para. 2 let. b SO).91\\nIf there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in \\nSwitzerland.92\\nThe following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: 93\\n•Special assets 94\\n\\n### Section: Page 14\\n14/70There is an obligation to cover the entire technical provisions from direct insurance \\nthrough a special fund. The gross technical provisions must be covered (without taking \\ninto account claims against reinsurers). If an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured \\nportions of the provisions (see margin nos. 160-175) exists for insurance companies that \\noperate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. It must be ensured \\nthat only those contracts participate in the special fund that are fully included in the target \\namount.\\nInstead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into \\naccount, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the \\ninsurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets.95\\nFor these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. 96\\n•Bankruptcy privilege\\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the special assets are primarily available to satisfy claims arising \\nfrom insurance contracts.97\\n•Investment guidelines\\nThe local supervisory authority specifies investment guidelines aimed at maintaining the \\nsecurity and value of the investment fund.98\\nc) Unit-linked life insurance policies\\nUnit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions must be linked to permissible \\nassets for the tied assets: In the case of unit-linked contracts, these are open-ended collective \\ninvestment schemes that fall under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA; SR 951.31) \\n(Art. 125a SO). In the case of contracts linked to internal investment portfolios or other \\nreference values, these are permissible values in accordance with Art. 79 SO and Art. 81 \\npara. 2 SO.99\\nThe investments used as collateral must correspond to those on which the contracts are \\nbased (matching cover; Art. 81 AVO), as otherwise the insurance company bears an \\nadditional investment risk. Any guarantees must be secured with investments in accordance \\nwith Art. 79 AVO that replicate the fluctuations in value of these guarantees as well as \\npossible. Other contractual components, non-unit-linked provisions and any supplement to the \\ntarget amount must be secured with values in accordance with Art. 79 AVO.100\\nIn accordance with Art. 93a AVO, investments to secure claims from unit-linked life insurance \\npolicies are valued at no more than market value, irrespective of\\nthe other capitalized values in accordance with Chapter IV.101\\n\\n### Section: Page 15\\n15/70d) Indirect investments: Initial acquisition, restructuring\\nAn investment - whether as an initial acquisition or through restructuring - in so-called indirect \\ninvestments (e.g. in funds, participations, structured products or bonds issued by special \\npurpose vehicles [SPVs]) may not be used to circumvent the provisions on direct investments \\nin accordance with Chapter IV.102\\nThis circular deals with the following indirect investments:\\n•collective investment schemes in accordance with margin nos. 484-493;\\n•Single investor funds according to margin nos. 494-505;\\n•Real estate companies in accordance with margin no. 256 (for a participation of more than \\n50%) or margin no. 240 (as a listed real estate company);\\n•structured products and securitized receivables in accordance with margin nos. 197 and \\n214;\\n•alternative investments in accordance with margin nos. 317-350.103\\nDepending on the instrument, specific qualitative requirements and a high level of liquidity are \\ndemanded for the entire investment instrument or a so-called look-through approach is \\napplied.

Chapters II and III set out FINMA\\'s expectations with regard to the overall \\ninvestment activity of all supervised insurance companies and, in particular, the general \\nrequirements in connection with the designation of tied assets (Art. 17 of the Insurance \\nSupervision Act [ISA; SR 961.01]). Chapters IV and V explain the requirements for the \\npermissible assets in tied assets (Art. 79 of the Supervision Ordinance [SO; SR 961.011]).1\\nII General principles for total assets\\nA. Investment principles\\nWhen selecting its investments, the insurance company takes into account the structure and \\ndevelopment of the obligations (asset liability management, ALM), the security of the \\ninvestments, appropriate diversification and the insurance company\\'s foreseeable need for \\nliquid assets.2\\nB. Derivative financial instruments\\na) Use of derivative financial instruments\\nInsurance companies may only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risks on the \\ninvestments or on their obligations to the insured persons or to manage the investments \\nefficiently (Art. 100 SO).3\\nWhen using derivatives, the insurance company may not take any risks that are inappropriate \\nto the scope of business and risk capacity of the insurance company. The use of derivatives \\nshould also be aimed at achieving a sustainable effect.4\\nb) Obligation to provide cover when using derivatives\\nIn accordance with Art. 100 para. 2 SO, all obligations that may arise from derivative financial \\ntransactions must be covered. The obligations must be covered at all times and in full \\n(contract volume / notional value) either by the underlying assets on which the derivatives are \\nbased (in the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell) or by liquidity (in the case of \\nderivatives with an obligation to buy).5\\nLiquidity can include both cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents\\nCash deposits in accordance with margin nos. 181-185 and government bonds with a minimum \\ncredit rating of 2 and very good liquidity are considered funds. In addition, the funds mentioned in \\nmargin no. 1146\\n\\n### Section: Page 4\\n4/70Receivables that are exempt from the counterparty limit are regarded as cash equivalents.\\nThe obligation is covered at all times and in full if: 7\\n•the liquidity or cash equivalents are available; 8\\n•the underlying assets are held by the insurance company and are available without \\nrestriction - securities lending in relation to the underlying assets and repurchase \\nagreements (repo, reverse repo) in connection with derivative transactions are not \\npermitted. Lent securities are an exception if the short-term recall of these securities is \\npossible without restriction. The increased operational risks arising from these \\ntransactions must be taken into account;9\\n•double use of liquidity or underlying assets to cover several transactions is excluded - \\nunderlying assets or liquidity can be used simultaneously to cover derivative positions if \\nthese involve several risks (e.g. a market, credit or currency risk) but relate to the same \\nunderlying assets;10\\n•the market value of the cash equivalents or the number of underlying assets covers the \\nentire obligation, whereby cash equivalents - with the exception of cash deposits in \\naccordance with margin nos. 181-185 - may only be used as cover to the extent of 90% of \\nthe market value.11\\nIn the case of derivatives with a purchase or acceptance obligation (e.g. long futures, long \\nforwards, short puts) of an underlying asset, such as a share, a financial index, a currency or \\nan interest rate, the liquidity required to fulfill the obligation must be available at all times.12\\nIn the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell or deliver (e.g. short futures, short forwards, \\nshort calls) an underlying asset, such as a share, a currency or an interest rate, the underlying \\ninvestment must be available at all times and without restriction to fulfill the obligation. In the \\ncase of index derivatives, the obligations are deemed to be covered if there is an extensive \\nand stable correlation between the underlying assets held and the index.13\\nIf there is a contractual right to satisfy an obligation entered into by means of a cash payment \\ninstead of delivery of the deliverable underlying, the physically deliverable underlying must \\nnevertheless be held.14\\nIf cash settlement is mandatory for underlyings that cannot be physically delivered (e.g. \\nunderlyings for weather derivatives), the necessary liquidity must be maintained in full at all \\ntimes in the event of an obligation to sell such derivatives.15\\nIn the case of derivatives with an obligation to exchange cash flows (e.g. interest rate swaps), \\nthe cash flow to be paid must be ensured with the necessary liquidity or underlying.\\nbecome.16\\n\\n### Section: Page 5\\n5/70In the case of combinations of derivatives, the obligations of the entire combination for the \\nfulfillment of the obligations must be covered at all times by underlying assets or liquidity \\navailable in the assets. The underlyings of the combinations must be identical to the \\nunderlyings used as cover.17\\nc) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance undertakings that use derivative financial instruments must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (margin no. 76).18\\nThe provisions of margin nos. 57-87 m u s t  also be observed mutatis mutandis when using \\nderivative financial instruments.19\\nd) Analysis of the risks associated with the use of derivative financial instruments\\nThe counterparty risks resulting from derivative transactions must be taken into account \\nbefore derivative financial instruments are used. The risks must be analyzed as often as the \\nsituation requires, but at least once a week for market risks and once a month for credit risks. \\nThe analysis of market and credit risks consists, among other things, of evaluating the open \\npositions and comparing them with the defined limits of risk exposure. The result of the risk \\nanalysis must be presented to the Executive Board as often as the situation requires, but at \\nleast once a month for market risks and at least once every three months for credit risks (Art. \\n104 SO).20\\nThe insurance company\\'s risk management ensures that the derivative strategies of different \\ndivisions are recorded centrally and analyzed for interdependencies. To this end, various \\nrelevant scenario calculations must be carried out to ensure that the overall use of derivatives \\ndoes not jeopardize the value of the assets or the solvency of the company. The insurance \\ncompany ensures that the economic impact on assets and solvency in connection with \\nderivative transactions is correctly shown in the various reports to FINMA.21\\nAccording to Art. 108 SO, an activity report on the use of derivative financial instruments must \\nbe submitted to the Board of Directors at least every six months.22\\nIII General principles for tied assets\\nA. Definition, purpose and obligation to appoint\\nThe values in the tied assets represent based on the\\nThe assets secure the claims of the insured persons based on the reported technical 23\\n\\n### Section: Page 6\\n6/70provisions. The\\n\\n### Section: Page 7\\n7/70Tied assets are of great importance in the event of a portfolio transfer and especially in the \\nevent of insolvency and the subsequent liquidation of the insurance company. The tied assets \\nprovide the insured persons with a liability substrate that ensures that their claims are satisfied \\nwith priority over other creditors in the event of the insurance company\\'s bankruptcy.\\nThe assets allocated to the tied assets must be secure, unencumbered property of the \\ninsurance company and realizable in the event of the bankruptcy of the insurance company in \\nSwitzerland. To ensure that the claims of the insured persons are effectively secured, \\nattention must be paid to the intrinsic value and stability of value when allocating assets to tied \\nassets.24\\nB. Principles\\na) Investment principles\\naa) Security\\nThe investments in tied assets must be selected in such a way that the claims arising from \\ninsurance contracts can be met at all times.25\\nThe security of investments is guaranteed if they are economically and legally secure. \\nEconomic security is understood to mean the preservation of the value of the capital or \\nassets; the legal security of the investments is measured by their availability and saleability. \\nThe requirement of economic and legal security applies to both direct and indirect \\ninvestments.26\\nThe following criteria in particular must be observed with regard to maintaining the value of \\nassets:\\n•the fluctuation in value of the total tied assets, whereby the extent of the fluctuation in \\nvalue that can be tolerated depends on the level of overfunding of the tied assets;\\n•the quality of the system;\\n•a reliable valuation method for the system.27\\nThe legal security of the system relates in particular to the following criteria:\\n•unrestricted power of disposal;\\n•the unrestricted saleability and transferability of the assets, in particular in the event of the \\ninsurance company\\'s bankruptcy.28\\nAssets that jeopardize the intrinsic value of the tied assets (e.g. assets that give rise to additional \\nfunding obligations at the expense of the tied assets) are not permitted.\\nassets).29\\n\\n### Section: Page 8\\n8/70bb) Orientation towards obligations (Asset Liability Management, ALM)\\nThe order of the tied assets must be based on the structure and expected development of the \\ninsurance obligations to be secured. Appropriate account must be taken of both the \\nperformance of investments and liabilities and the expected cash flows from investments and \\nobligations.30\\ncc) Profitability\\nThe insurance company selects investments that generate a return in line with the market. 31\\ndd) Diversification\\nEach tied asset must be sufficiently and appropriately diversified. Cluster risks must be \\nexcluded. An appropriate mix in relation to the various investment categories and a spread of \\ninvestments in relation to the debtors of the assets must be achieved.32\\nAn appropriate mix of investments with regard to the various investment categories takes into \\naccount the following criteria in particular:\\n•the specific risk profile and default risk or impairment risk of the investments;\\n•the investment horizon (i.e. investment period) of the investment;\\n•the correlation of asset classes.33\\nAn appropriate diversification of investments takes into account at least the following criteria:\\n•various counterparties;\\n•different geographical regions;\\n•different industries and segments.34\\nInvestments in high-risk investments may only be made as a cautious addition to and \\nappropriate diversification of the total tied assets. The risk capacity of the insurance company \\nmust always be taken into account. Investments in securities with a credit rating of 5 are only \\npermitted if there is corresponding technical expertise in the area of credit risks.35\\nee) Liquidity\\nIn principle, the insurance company must choose investments that can be realized quickly if \\nnecessary, especially in the event of the insurance company\\'s bankruptcy.36\\nThe realizability of an investment depends, among other things, on the term of an investment \\n(e.g. bonds, fixed-term deposits) or the possibility of assigning (selling) the investment on the \\nmarket or on a stock exchange.37\\n\\n### Section: Page 9\\n9/70b) Prohibition of charging and offsetting\\nThe value of the tied assets must be unencumbered (Art. 84 para. 2 SO). In principle, the tied \\nassets may not be encumbered by liens, rights of retention, rights of set-off or similar rights. \\nNo additional funding obligations may be created to the detriment of the tied assets. \\nExceptions are set out in Chapters IV and V.38\\nc) Realization in bankruptcy\\nThe assets in tied assets serve solely to secure claims arising from insurance contracts in the \\nevent of the insolvency and liquidation of the insurance company under bankruptcy law. It \\nmust therefore be ensured that the assets flow into the bankruptcy estate and can be \\nliquidated in Swiss bankruptcy proceedings.39\\nThe recoverability in bankruptcy must be ensured by the insurance company, whereby proof can \\nbe provided as follows:40\\n•The investment is securitized and traded on a market so that a market price can be \\ndetermined; or41\\n•the legal system applicable to the investment recognizes FINMA\\'s insolvency proceedings \\nand the priority privilege of tied assets under Swiss law, so that special executions or \\nother interventions by an authority or third parties are not possible.42\\nAt FINMA\\'s request, the possibility of realizability in Swiss bankruptcy must be demonstrated. 43\\nd) Obligation to provide cover at all times\\nThe insurance company shall take suitable organizational measures to ensure that the current \\ndebit amount pursuant to Art. 56 and 57 or 68 SO is covered at all times by permissible assets \\npursuant to Art. 68 para. 2, 79 and 81 SO. The amount of the current target amount is \\ndetermined on the basis of the current provisions if a statement of account were prepared at \\nthat time.44\\nInstead of a concrete calculation of the current provisions, well-founded and prudent estimates \\ncan also be used during the year, provided that it can be demonstrated with a high degree of \\ncertainty that the current target amount is actually covered by the calculated values.45\\nThis ensures that even after events and developments occurring during the year that require \\nfurther technical provisions and require a\\nhave an influence on the target amount (e.g. unexpected claims, need for additional reserves),46\\n\\n### Section: Page 10\\n10/70acquisition of new business or business growth) sufficient assets are available to cover the \\ntarget amount of the tied assets.\\ne) Order\\nThe insurance company establishes the tied assets by allocating assets. It records and \\nidentifies these assets in such a way that it can prove at any time without delay which assets \\nbelong to the tied assets and that the target amount of each tied asset is covered (Art. 76 \\npara. 1 AVO).47\\nf) Criteria for the allocation of assets to restricted assets\\nAn asset can be allocated to restricted assets if: 48\\n•the investment is an admissible value in accordance with Art. 79 or Art. 68 para. 2 SO and \\nis eligible in accordance with this Circular. Partial crediting of investments (e.g. due to \\nnon-creditable parts or increased risks) is not permitted. Partial offsetting of the \\ninvestment is only possible if the exception is explicitly described in this circular (e.g. \\nmortgages, margin no. 312);49\\n•the investment can generally be valued without any problems; 50\\n•the investment has a high level of liquidity in relation to the corresponding investment \\ncategory;51\\n•the necessary expertise is available and appropriate processes and systems are applied \\nthat are necessary for the professional selection, management and control of the \\ninvestment made (margin no. 76);52\\n•The effects of the investment and its individual risk components are understood so that \\nthe financial, legal and operational risks can be assessed at all times;53\\n•the debtor\\'s creditworthiness is verifiable (margin no. 139-152); 54\\n•the asset is neither encumbered nor can it be offset against third-party claims (margin no. 38). 55\\nThese principles are specified for each investment category in Chapters IV and V. 56\\nC. Investment strategy\\nThe Executive Board determines the investment strategy and submits it to the Board of Directors \\nfor approval (Art. 78 para. 1 let. a, Art. 101 SO).57\\nThe investment strategy takes appropriate account of the type and complexity of the business \\nconducted, in particular the insurance business (Art. 102 para. 1 SO).58\\n\\n### Section: Page 11\\n11/70The framework conditions for the use of the various investment categories must be defined in \\nthe investment strategy. All investments must be anchored in the investment strategy of the \\ncompany as a whole.59\\nThe limits of risk exposure must be set in accordance with the financial and organizational \\ncapacities of the insurance company.60\\nD. Investment regulations\\nThe investment regulations are issued by the Executive Board or a member of the Executive \\nBoard or the general representative and define the entire investment activity (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. b, Art. 106 para. 1 SO). The investment activity is comprehensively described in a \\ndocument, whereby specific references to other internal directives are possible.61\\nThe requirements for the investment regulations are based on the complexity of the investments \\nin the investment universe defined by the insurance company.62\\nThe insurance company regulates at least the following topics in the investment regulations: 63\\n•Internal investment principles and objectives (incl. ALM); 64\\n•Description of the investment universe (permitted investments / restrictions); 65\\n•Investment techniques and their area of application/purpose (e.g. use of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, securities lending, repurchase agreements);66\\n•Description of the investment process, monitoring and controls (definition of tasks, \\nresponsibilities, competencies, accountability and escalation mechanisms);67\\n•Staff requirements (e.g. specialist knowledge, experience, integrity). 68\\nE. Organization and control\\nThe administration (investment management) and control (risk management) of the \\ninvestment activity must be carried out by persons who are independent of each other and \\nmust be organizationally appropriate to the complexity of the business and investment activity \\n(Art. 78, 106 SO).69\\nThe staff must have adequate qualifications and knowledge of the asset classes invested in \\nand, in the case of investments in riskier investments, appropriate expertise (Art. 78 para. 1 \\nlet. c, Art. 107 SO).70\\nThe systems used should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the investment portfolio, \\nbe monitored and have the necessary stability (Art. 106 para. 2 SO).71\\n\\n### Section: Page 12\\n12/70The administration (investment management) must ensure and perform at least the following \\ntasks:72\\n•the implementation of the investment strategy and the investment regulations; 73\\n•the definition and documentation of the strategic and tactical asset allocation, which is \\nadapted to the risk capacity, size and complexity of the insurance company, whereby the \\nallocation is made in relation to asset classes and other important characteristics such as \\nduration, sectors, creditworthiness and investment styles;74\\n•setting a limit system based on individual risk capacity, monitoring limits and defining \\nmeasures in the event of limit breaches;75\\n•the provision of an investment process that is commensurate with the complexity of the \\ninvestments. Scenario analyses must be used to ensure that the use of complex \\ninvestments does not jeopardize the value of the total assets and tied assets or the \\nsolvency of the insurance company;76\\n•monitoring the value of the assets; 77\\n•monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 78\\n•monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities;79\\n•the measurement and evaluation of investment results; 80\\n•the definition of internal reporting. 81\\nIf the insurance company commissions a third party with investment management, this does \\nnot relieve it of responsibility for compliance with the investment management regulations. In \\nparticular, the insurance company must understand the investment process, monitor the \\nspecified strategy and investment principles and be able to track all transactions in a timely \\nmanner for accounting purposes.82\\nThe transfer of investment management to third parties is subject to FINMA approval in \\naccordance with Art. 4 para. 2 let. j ISA.83\\nControl (risk management) must ensure and perform at least the following tasks: 84\\n•monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives in \\naccordance with margin no. 64 and the other internal directives of the insurance company;85\\n•monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements; 86\\n\\n### Section: Page 13\\n13/70•monitoring and controlling the main risks (in particular market risk, credit risk, \\nconcentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection \\nwith investment activities.87\\nF. Further provisions\\na) Separate tied assets\\nSeparate tied assets are to be ordered for (Art. 77 para. 1 AVO):\\n•occupational pension insurance;\\n•the policyholder claims from unit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions \\n(insurance classes A2.1, A2.2, A2.3 and A6.1);\\n•the policyholder claims from insurance contracts or capitalization transactions that are \\nlinked to internal investment portfolios or other reference values (insurance sections A2.4, \\nA2.5, A2.6 and A6.2).\\nThe appointment of further tied assets is possible (Art. 77 para. 2 SO) and may be ordered by \\nFINMA in justified cases (para. 3).88\\nIn Art. 77 para. 1 let. b and c AVO, reference is no longer made to the savings portion of the \\ninsurance contracts, but to the entire insured persons\\' claims. In particular, this is intended to \\navoid the previously separate safeguarding of the savings and guarantee components.89\\nThis Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined \\nlimits, the coverage obligations and the qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be \\ntaken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization \\ntransactions (insurance classes A2.1-A2.6 as well as A6.1 and A6.2), however, exceptions \\napply with regard to the limits (see margin no. 122).90\\nb) Foreign insurance portfolio\\nThe insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied \\nassets if equivalent security must be provided abroad (Art. 17 para. 2 ISA). If no equivalent \\nsecurity has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the \\nprovision can be made in separate tied assets (Art. 77 para. 2 let. b SO).91\\nIf there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in \\nSwitzerland.92\\nThe following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: 93\\n•Special assets 94\\n\\n### Section: Page 14\\n14/70There is an obligation to cover the entire technical provisions from direct insurance \\nthrough a special fund. The gross technical provisions must be covered (without taking \\ninto account claims against reinsurers). If an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured \\nportions of the provisions (see margin nos. 160-175) exists for insurance companies that \\noperate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. It must be ensured \\nthat only those contracts participate in the special fund that are fully included in the target \\namount.\\nInstead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into \\naccount, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the \\ninsurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets.95\\nFor these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. 96\\n•Bankruptcy privilege\\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the special assets are primarily available to satisfy claims arising \\nfrom insurance contracts.97\\n•Investment guidelines\\nThe local supervisory authority specifies investment guidelines aimed at maintaining the \\nsecurity and value of the investment fund.98\\nc) Unit-linked life insurance policies\\nUnit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions must be linked to permissible \\nassets for the tied assets: In the case of unit-linked contracts, these are open-ended collective \\ninvestment schemes that fall under the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA; SR 951.31) \\n(Art. 125a SO). In the case of contracts linked to internal investment portfolios or other \\nreference values, these are permissible values in accordance with Art. 79 SO and Art. 81 \\npara. 2 SO.99\\nThe investments used as collateral must correspond to those on which the contracts are \\nbased (matching cover; Art. 81 AVO), as otherwise the insurance company bears an \\nadditional investment risk. Any guarantees must be secured with investments in accordance \\nwith Art. 79 AVO that replicate the fluctuations in value of these guarantees as well as \\npossible. Other contractual components, non-unit-linked provisions and any supplement to the \\ntarget amount must be secured with values in accordance with Art. 79 AVO.100\\nIn accordance with Art. 93a AVO, investments to secure claims from unit-linked life insurance \\npolicies are valued at no more than market value, irrespective of\\nthe other capitalized values in accordance with Chapter IV.101\\n\\n### Section: Page 15\\n15/70d) Indirect investments: Initial acquisition, restructuring\\nAn investment - whether as an initial acquisition or through restructuring - in so-called indirect \\ninvestments (e.g. in funds, participations, structured products or bonds issued by special \\npurpose vehicles [SPVs]) may not be used to circumvent the provisions on direct investments \\nin accordance with Chapter IV.102\\nThis circular deals with the following indirect investments:\\n•collective investment schemes in accordance with margin nos. 484-493;\\n•Single investor funds according to margin nos. 494-505;\\n•Real estate companies in accordance with margin no. 256 (for a participation of more than \\n50%) or margin no. 240 (as a listed real estate company);\\n•structured products and securitized receivables in accordance with margin nos. 197 and \\n214;\\n•alternative investments in accordance with margin nos. 317-350.103\\nDepending on the instrument, specific qualitative requirements and a high level of liquidity are \\ndemanded for the entire investment instrument or a so-called look-through approach is \\napplied. An investment in an indirect investment that contains a non-eligible direct investment \\nis only permitted if the specific provisions for the indirect investment are met and its \\ncharacteristics mean that the disadvantages that lead to the non-eligibility of the direct \\ninvestment do not affect the indirect investment.104\\nExample: An investment in real estate that is relatively illiquid and difficult to value and is \\ntherefore not a permissible investment in tied assets cannot be counted as a permissible \\ninvestment even if it is restructured as an indirect investment. It can only be included if the risk \\nsituation for the investor actually improves, as illustrated by the following list based on an \\ninvestment in real estate.105\\n106Structure Creditable?

If the investment or the structure contains an additional security, the investment \\nmay only be included in the tied assets if this compensates for the deficiency relating to the \\nnon-eligible part.107\\nf) Limits\\naa) General\\nBased on Art. 83 SO, limits are set for individual investment categories. 108\\nAn insurance company may hold no more than the percentage of the target amount of each \\nindividual tied asset specified as a limit for investments in a particular investment category.109\\nBoth the general limits (see margin nos. 113-122) and the special limits for each investment \\ncategory must be observed.110\\nExceeding the specified limits is permitted within the scope of the excess cover of the target \\namount. Limits are deemed to have been exceeded if a situation can be achieved by \\nwithdrawing assets from the tied assets in which all limits are complied with and the target \\namount of the tied assets is still covered.111\\ni\\nThe insurance company shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the limits are \\ncomplied with at all times. Securities that have been transferred to securities lending or \\nrepurchase agreements must be included in the calculation of the limits.112\\nbb) Counterparty limits\\nThe exposure to a counterparty may not exceed 5% of the target amount of the tied assets. If \\nthere is a higher exposure per counterparty, this must be submitted to FINMA for approval \\nwithout delay.113\\nClaims against the Swiss Confederation, cantons, cantonal banks with a state guarantee and \\nSwiss mortgage bond institutions are exempt from the 5 % limit.\\nexcluded. Receivables from debtors whose obligations are due at any time and114\\n\\n### Section: Page 17\\n17/70are fully guaranteed by a state with a credit rating of 1 are also excluded from this limit.\\nTo determine the net exposure, all receivables and investment instruments in the tied assets \\nvis-à-vis this party must be accumulated. If the insurance company invests in several \\ncompanies within a group, the total exposure to this group is decisive. Guarantees issued to \\nthe insurance company, e.g. in connection with structured products, are also included in the \\ncalculation of net exposure. Collateral received can be deducted from the exposure.115\\ncc) Foreign currency limits\\nThe obligations arising from the insurance contracts should be covered by investments in \\nmatching currencies. Investments in currencies other than the reference currency are limited \\nto 20% of the target amount of the tied assets. The reference currency is the currency in \\nwhich the insurance contracts concluded by the insurance company are denominated.116\\ndd) Exceptions\\nUpon request, an insurance undertaking may deviate from the limits for the categories equities \\nand other listed equity securities (margin no. 244), real estate (margin nos. 266-269), \\nmortgages (margin nos. 291-293) and the limits for net currency exposure (margin no. 116) \\nand apply for its own limits for these categories. The insurance company may apply for its own \\nlimits under the following conditions:117\\n•The insurance company plausibly demonstrates that no negative effects on the solvency \\nof the company are to be expected as a result of the requested own funds.118\\n•The insurance company demonstrates that it has an appropriate risk management system \\nin place for the relevant asset classes.119\\n•The insurance undertaking must be able to demonstrate at all times that the chosen limits \\ncontinue to comply with the principles of this Circular on tied assets and that sufficient \\naccount is taken of the risk of a shortfall in the target amount of tied assets as a result of a \\nsignificant reduction in the value of the corresponding investment category. To this end, \\nthe insurance company must demonstrate plausibly by means of regular tests that stress \\nscenarios on the tied assets will not lead to a shortfall in the target amount of the tied \\nassets, even if its own limits apply. The available free, unencumbered assets must also be \\nincluded in these considerations.120\\n•The requirements must be met at all times, even after approval. As soon as the conditions \\nfor the own limits are no longer met, the insurer must be authorized.\\nThe insurance companies must comply with the specified limits.121\\n\\n### Section: Page 18\\n18/70ee) Unit-linked life insurance\\nIn unit-linked life insurance, the tied assets must be determined by the assets underlying the \\ncontracts. Therefore, the quantitative limits of this Circular do not apply to the separate tied \\nassets of unit-linked life insurance (Art. 77 para. 1 let. b SO). For the separate tied assets of \\nlife insurance linked to internal investment portfolios or other reference assets (Art. 77 para. 1 \\nlet. c S O ), only the limits of this circular apply.\\n\"Exposure to a counterparty\" and \"Securities lending and repurchase agreements\" must be \\nobserved. However, these limits may be exceeded if the policyholder has been expressly \\ninformed of the possible deviation from these limits before the contract is concluded.122\\ng) Compliance with the investment principles for small target amounts\\nThe investment principles of security, ALM, profitability, diversification and liquidity (see margin \\nnos. 25-37) must also be observed by small insurance companies.123\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If the value of an investment is at risk (need for impairment), \\nthe ordinary valuation method (e.g. cost amortization method for bonds) must be deviated \\nfrom for inclusion in tied assets and the inclusion must be at most at market value (cf. Art. 95 \\npara. 2 AVO). This may affect the following investment categories in particular:125\\n•Cash contributions (see margin nos. 181-185) 126\\n•Bonds, convertible bonds (see margin nos. 186-196) 127\\n•Structured products (see margin nos. 197-213) 128\\n•Other acknowledgements of debt (see margin nos. 227-239) 129\\n•Mortgages (see margin nos. 288-316) 130\\n\\n### Section: Page 19\\n19/70•Derivative financial instruments (see margin nos. 351-478) 131\\ni) Foreign assets\\nAn allocation of valuable assets abroad in accordance with Chapters IV and V is possible if \\nthe requirements of margin nos. 39-43 are met or the special provisions explicitly regulate an \\nallocation.132\\nj) Group relations\\nIntra-Group investments - in particular equity investments, treasury shares or shares of other \\nGroup companies, treasury bonds, bonds of other Group companies, loans to Group \\ncompanies, derivative financial instruments from transactions with Group companies - cannot \\nbe counted as tied assets, with the exceptions listed below.133\\nLoans to investment companies that meet the conditions of Art. 82 para. 4 SO may be \\nallocated to tied assets and credited at nominal value, provided the borrower does not have \\nany loans to Group companies on its own books.134\\nParticipations in investment companies that meet the conditions of Art. 82 para. 4 SO may be \\nincluded in the tied assets at net asset value (NAV).135\\nLoans to real estate companies in which an interest of more than 50% is held can be allocated \\nto restricted assets and recognized at nominal value, provided that liquidation of the company \\ncan be enforced and the borrower does not have any loans to Group companies on its own \\nbooks.136\\nParticipations in real estate companies in accordance with Art. 79 para. 1 let. f SO may be \\nincluded in the tied assets at NAV if the participation is more than 50% and liquidation can be \\nenforced.137\\nThis is intended to prevent intragroup investments whose value is doubtful in the event of \\nbankruptcy from being counted as tied assets. Double counting of investments (double \\ngearing) is also prevented.138\\nk) Credit ratings\\nThe following credit ratings are to be used for ordering tied assets: 139\\nCredit rating level 1: 140\\n\\n### Section: Page 20\\n20/70Highest grade, debtor with the highest credit rating. The debtor\\'s ability to meet its financial \\nobligations is outstanding. The default risk is virtually negligible, even in the longer term.\\nCredit rating level 2:\\nHigh grade, safe investment. The default risk is virtually negligible, but may be somewhat \\nmore difficult to assess in the longer term; the debtor\\'s ability to meet its financial obligations is \\nvery strong.141\\nCredit rating level 3:\\nUpper Medium grade. Safe investment, provided no unforeseen events affect the overall \\neconomy or industry. The borrower\\'s ability to meet its financial obligations is strong, but \\nsomewhat more vulnerable to the adverse effects of changes in external circumstances and \\neconomic conditions.142\\nCredit rating level 4:\\nLower Medium grade, average investment. However, problems are to be expected if the \\noverall economy deteriorates. The borrower\\'s ability to meet its financial obligations is \\nadequate, but more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.143\\nCredit rating level 5:\\nAll investments that do not meet the requirements for classification in one of the credit rating \\ncategories 1-4.144\\nFor regulatory purposes, the insurance company only uses ratings from recognized rating \\nagencies in accordance with FINMA Circular 2012/1 when assigning tied assets to the credit \\nrating categories\\n\"Rating agencies\" or own credit ratings.145\\nOwn credit ratings must meet the following requirements: 146\\n•They are created under our own responsibility according to comprehensible criteria. 147\\n•They represent the assessment of the default risk from the perspective of the insurance \\ncompany.148\\n•The sources of information used are scrutinized in terms of how they were obtained, their \\nobjectivity and their reliability.149\\n•They are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted if necessary. 150\\n•The processes for their creation and use are documented. 151\\n\\n### Section: Page 21\\n21/70The outsourcing of the process must be reported to FINMA in accordance with Art. 4 para. 2 \\nlet. j ISA.

Safekeeping of assets\\na) Self-custody\\nThe movable assets allocated to the tied assets may be held in custody by the insurance \\ncompany or the Swiss branch (Art. 86 para. 1 SO).

Receivables of non-life insurers from reinsurers\\na) Principles\\nThe reinsured portions of the provisions are offset against the tied assets of the non-life \\ninsurance companies in accordance with Art. 68 Para. 2 AVO.160\\nThe applications for offsetting the reinsured portions of the provisions and their approvals \\nrelate to the reinsurance companies and not to the amount of the reinsured portions. If \\noffsetting has been approved in relation to a reinsurer, the current amount of the reinsured \\nportions can be offset, subject to compliance with the limits in accordance with margin nos. \\n162-169. Offsetting of the reinsured portions of the provisions against a reinsurer can be \\napplied for as soon as a corresponding reinsurance contract exists, regardless of whether \\nreinsured portions of the provisions already exist.161\\nb) Crediting and limits\\nThe reinsured portions of the provisions are generally credited at 100% of the amount of the \\ncurrent portion; for reinsurers in run-off, at 75% of the amount of the current portion. In any \\ncase, the offsetting is limited as follows in accordance with the credit rating levels under \\nmargin nos. 139-144:162\\n•If the reinsurer's credit rating is 2 or better: 20% of the target amount of the bundled \\nassets.163\\n•For credit rating level 3 of the reinsurer: 10% of the target amount of the tied assets. 164\\n•For credit rating level 4 of the reinsurer: 5% of the target amount of the tied assets. 165\\n•In the case of reinsurers with a credit rating of 5, the reinsured portions of the provisions \\ncannot be offset against the tied assets.166\\nThese limits are reduced by 50% for reinsured portions of the provisions from contracts with \\ninsurers that belong to the same group as the insurance company.167\\nWhen offsetting reinsured portions of provisions relating to several reinsurers belonging to the \\nsame group, the total of the offsets is limited to 1.5 times the limits (margin no. 162-166) \\n(based on the group's credit quality step).\\nlimited.168\\n\\n### Section: Page 23\\n23/70FINMA may, upon request, approve offsetting beyond the stated limits, provided this does not \\nimpair the security of the tied assets.169\\nc) Special reinsurance relationships\\nReinsured portions of the provisions relating to the Swiss natural hazard pool can be credited \\nup to 10% of the target amount of the tied assets in each case.170\\nd) Application and approval procedure\\nThe form prescribed by FINMA must be used for the applications. If reinsurance contracts are \\nconcluded with branches of reinsurers, the name and registered office of the company's head \\noffice must be stated on the form.171\\nIn justified cases, FINMA may limit the duration of approvals, in particular approvals in \\naccordance with margin no. 169.172\\nApplications are deemed to have been approved unless FINMA initiates a review within four \\nweeks.173\\nIf the conditions change, in particular the assessment of the creditworthiness of an approved \\nreinsurer, the crediting must be adjusted in accordance with the limits set out in margin nos. \\n162-166 and FINMA must be notified immediately.174\\nIf a further reinsurer is to be approved in addition to those already approved, all reinsurers \\nmust be listed in the application. Those not yet approved must be marked.175\\nI. Authorizations pursuant to Art. 79 para. 3 AVO\\nFINMA may, on request, allow further assets to be included in the tied assets, provided this \\ndoes not impair the security of the tied assets (Art. 79 para. 3 SO). FINMA bases its \\nassessment of these applications in particular on margin nos. 23-159 of this Circular.176\\nJ. Reporting to FINMA\\nWithin three months of the end of the financial year, the insurance company shall inform the \\naudit company of the target amount calculated at the end of the financial year for each tied \\nasset together with the list of cover assets. Reporting to FINMA takes place within four months \\nof the end of the financial year (Art. 72 para. 1 SO).177\\nInsurance companies domiciled in Switzerland must also report on every foreign insurance \\nportfolio for which they have to provide security abroad.178\\n\\n### Section: Page 24\\n24/70FINMA defines the requirements and the process for reporting tied assets on an annual basis. 179\\nIV. forms of investment in tied assets\\nIn addition to the general principles listed above, the following principles apply to the systems. 180\\nA. Cash deposits\\na) Permissible values\\nCash and cash deposits, namely bank balances as well as fixed-term deposits and other \\nmoney market investments are permitted. Other money market investments include short-term \\nmoney market investments with a term of up to 12 months.181\\nb) Special requirements\\nThe supplementary agreement in accordance with margin no. 154 must also be signed with \\nthe counterparty for cash deposits or account balances. In particular, the supplementary \\nagreement must exclude any lien, right of retention, right of set-off or similar right on the part \\nof the debtor.182\\nIn the case of claims against a debtor domiciled abroad, margin no. 132 must be observed. 183\\nc) Evaluation\\nInvestments in this category are valued at no more than their nominal value, taking into account \\nthe security and income (Art. 93 para. 2 SO).184\\nMoney market debt register claims are recognized at no more than market value. If they are not \\nlisted on a stock exchange, a standard market valuation method must be applied.185\\nB. Bonds, convertible bonds\\na) Permissible values\\nThe following values are assigned to this category:\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The \\nsecuritized receivable can be divided into several tranches (senior, junior, equity tranche). The \\npool of receivables can have a uniform or mixed composition and consist of physical or \\nsynthetic (structured) receivables. Examples of securitized receivables are Asset Backed \\nSecurities (ABS), Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS, RMBS, CMBS) and Collateralized Debt \\nObligations (CDO, CBO, CLO, CMO, SFCDO).214\\nb) Permissible values\\nOnly investments in securitized receivables that can be assessed by the insurance company \\nin terms of transparency, degree of complexity, recoverability (valuation) and risk are \\npermitted.215\\nc)Non-permissible values\\nThe following values in particular are not permitted: 216\\n•Intragroup transactions with securitized receivables (margin no. 133-138). 217\\n•Investments in the high-risk tranches of a securitized receivable, i.e. in particular in the \\nequity tranche, junior tranches and mezzanine tranches. Investments in higher tranches \\n(senior tranches, super-senior tranches) are also excluded if, taking into account all \\nrelevant aspects, they do not correspond to an investment with at least credit quality step \\n4. This assessment must not be based on external credit enhancements (e.g. guarantees, \\npledges). The assessment of the underlying assets is therefore relevant. Structure-related \\ncredit enhancements (e.g. excess spread, reserve account, overcollateralization) may be \\nincluded in the analysis. The assessment process must meet the requirements of margin \\nnos. 221-224.218\\n•Investments in securitized receivables whose receivables pool is actively managed \\n(managed CDO), if this restricts the insurance company in its assessment of the risks and \\nrecoverability of the receivables pool. If the investment restrictions and the management of \\nthe receivables pool are designed in such a way that the insurance company can promptly \\ntrack changes in the composition and determine the effects on the risks and recoverability, \\ninvestments in managed CDOs are permitted.219\\n•CDOs of CDOs and similar nested structures. 220\\n\\n### Section: Page 29\\n29/70d) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance undertakings that invest in securitized receivables must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (margin no. 76).221\\nThe insurance company must analyze and understand the risks of securitized receivables. If \\nthird parties are involved in the analysis, any conflicts of interest must be clarified in advance. \\nThe underlying pool of receivables must be analyzed with regard to its composition and \\nrecoverability (assumptions about the distribution of default probabilities, recovery rates). In \\norder to make an assessment of the performance of a securitized receivable, it is therefore \\nnecessary to have knowledge of the markets underlying the assets in the receivables pool. It \\nmust also be taken into account whether the pool of receivables is physically present or has \\nbeen created synthetically (e.g. with the help of credit default swaps), whether the \\nsecuritization relates to cash flows or market values, whether the pool of receivables is fixed \\nor is actively restructured, etc. A close examination of the structure is essential to determine \\nthe recoverability and risk of the securitized receivable. The analysis of the structure of the \\nsecuritized receivable usually requires a breakdown into the individual stages of the \\nsecuritization. At each stage, the risks and the built-in hedging measures must be closely \\nscrutinized with regard to their effect.222\\nThe volume ratios of the purchased tranche and the portfolio covering this tranche \\n(subordination), the size of the subordinated tranches and the waterfall structure must be \\nexamined in detail.223\\nThe insurance company establishes a due diligence process that guarantees a \\ncomprehensive and in-depth analysis of the structure, underlying risks and general conditions \\nof the securitized receivable. This review is intended to ensure that the investment is only \\nmade in securitized receivables whose value and risks can be tracked at all times and which \\ncomply with the insurance company's risk policy.224\\ne) Limitations\\nThe investment in securitized receivables is limited to 10% of the target amount. The imputed \\nvalue per investment may not exceed 1% of the target amount.225\\nf) Evaluation\\nThe securitized receivables are recognized at no more than their market value. When \\ndetermining the value, the quality of the valuation (e.g. with regard to the liquidity of the \\nsecuritized asset) must also be taken into account.\\nmarket) are reviewed.226\\n\\n### Section: Page 30\\n30/70E.

If the investment or the structure contains an additional security, the investment \\nmay only be included in the tied assets if this compensates for the deficiency relating to the \\nnon-eligible part.107\\nf) Limits\\naa) General\\nBased on Art. 83 SO, limits are set for individual investment categories. 108\\nAn insurance company may hold no more than the percentage of the target amount of each \\nindividual tied asset specified as a limit for investments in a particular investment category.109\\nBoth the general limits (see margin nos. 113-122) and the special limits for each investment \\ncategory must be observed.110\\nExceeding the specified limits is permitted within the scope of the excess cover of the target \\namount. Limits are deemed to have been exceeded if a situation can be achieved by \\nwithdrawing assets from the tied assets in which all limits are complied with and the target \\namount of the tied assets is still covered.111\\ni\\nThe insurance company shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the limits are \\ncomplied with at all times. Securities that have been transferred to securities lending or \\nrepurchase agreements must be included in the calculation of the limits.112\\nbb) Counterparty limits\\nThe exposure to a counterparty may not exceed 5% of the target amount of the tied assets. If \\nthere is a higher exposure per counterparty, this must be submitted to FINMA for approval \\nwithout delay.113\\nClaims against the Swiss Confederation, cantons, cantonal banks with a state guarantee and \\nSwiss mortgage bond institutions are exempt from the 5 % limit.\\nexcluded. Receivables from debtors whose obligations are due at any time and114\\n\\n### Section: Page 17\\n17/70are fully guaranteed by a state with a credit rating of 1 are also excluded from this limit.\\nTo determine the net exposure, all receivables and investment instruments in the tied assets \\nvis-à-vis this party must be accumulated. If the insurance company invests in several \\ncompanies within a group, the total exposure to this group is decisive. Guarantees issued to \\nthe insurance company, e.g. in connection with structured products, are also included in the \\ncalculation of net exposure. Collateral received can be deducted from the exposure.115\\ncc) Foreign currency limits\\nThe obligations arising from the insurance contracts should be covered by investments in \\nmatching currencies. Investments in currencies other than the reference currency are limited \\nto 20% of the target amount of the tied assets. The reference currency is the currency in \\nwhich the insurance contracts concluded by the insurance company are denominated.116\\ndd) Exceptions\\nUpon request, an insurance undertaking may deviate from the limits for the categories equities \\nand other listed equity securities (margin no. 244), real estate (margin nos. 266-269), \\nmortgages (margin nos. 291-293) and the limits for net currency exposure (margin no. 116) \\nand apply for its own limits for these categories. The insurance company may apply for its own \\nlimits under the following conditions:117\\n•The insurance company plausibly demonstrates that no negative effects on the solvency \\nof the company are to be expected as a result of the requested own funds.118\\n•The insurance company demonstrates that it has an appropriate risk management system \\nin place for the relevant asset classes.119\\n•The insurance undertaking must be able to demonstrate at all times that the chosen limits \\ncontinue to comply with the principles of this Circular on tied assets and that sufficient \\naccount is taken of the risk of a shortfall in the target amount of tied assets as a result of a \\nsignificant reduction in the value of the corresponding investment category. To this end, \\nthe insurance company must demonstrate plausibly by means of regular tests that stress \\nscenarios on the tied assets will not lead to a shortfall in the target amount of the tied \\nassets, even if its own limits apply. The available free, unencumbered assets must also be \\nincluded in these considerations.120\\n•The requirements must be met at all times, even after approval. As soon as the conditions \\nfor the own limits are no longer met, the insurer must be authorized.\\nThe insurance companies must comply with the specified limits.121\\n\\n### Section: Page 18\\n18/70ee) Unit-linked life insurance\\nIn unit-linked life insurance, the tied assets must be determined by the assets underlying the \\ncontracts. Therefore, the quantitative limits of this Circular do not apply to the separate tied \\nassets of unit-linked life insurance (Art. 77 para. 1 let. b SO). For the separate tied assets of \\nlife insurance linked to internal investment portfolios or other reference assets (Art. 77 para. 1 \\nlet. c S O ), only the limits of this circular apply.\\n\"Exposure to a counterparty\" and \"Securities lending and repurchase agreements\" must be \\nobserved. However, these limits may be exceeded if the policyholder has been expressly \\ninformed of the possible deviation from these limits before the contract is concluded.122\\ng) Compliance with the investment principles for small target amounts\\nThe investment principles of security, ALM, profitability, diversification and liquidity (see margin \\nnos. 25-37) must also be observed by small insurance companies.123\\nSmall insurance undertakings with only a small debit amount of tied assets may apply for an \\nexception to the 5% counterparty limit in justified cases (margin no. 113). In addition to the \\nreasons for the intended deviation from the counterparty limit, the application must contain \\ninformation on the debtor of the claims that account for more than 5% of the target amount of \\ntied assets and the amount of the requested counterparty limit, taking into account the \\nprinciple of appropriate diversification.124\\nh)Ensuring recoverability\\nThe insurance company must review the value of the individual investment on an ongoing \\nbasis and take into account any impairment as a result of a deterioration in creditworthiness in \\nthe valuation of the investment. If the value of an investment is at risk (need for impairment), \\nthe ordinary valuation method (e.g. cost amortization method for bonds) must be deviated \\nfrom for inclusion in tied assets and the inclusion must be at most at market value (cf. Art. 95 \\npara. 2 AVO). This may affect the following investment categories in particular:125\\n•Cash contributions (see margin nos. 181-185) 126\\n•Bonds, convertible bonds (see margin nos. 186-196) 127\\n•Structured products (see margin nos. 197-213) 128\\n•Other acknowledgements of debt (see margin nos. 227-239) 129\\n•Mortgages (see margin nos. 288-316) 130\\n\\n### Section: Page 19\\n19/70•Derivative financial instruments (see margin nos. 351-478) 131\\ni) Foreign assets\\nAn allocation of valuable assets abroad in accordance with Chapters IV and V is possible if \\nthe requirements of margin nos. 39-43 are met or the special provisions explicitly regulate an \\nallocation.132\\nj) Group relations\\nIntra-Group investments - in particular equity investments, treasury shares or shares of other \\nGroup companies, treasury bonds, bonds of other Group companies, loans to Group \\ncompanies, derivative financial instruments from transactions with Group companies - cannot \\nbe counted as tied assets, with the exceptions listed below.133\\nLoans to investment companies that meet the conditions of Art. 82 para. 4 SO may be \\nallocated to tied assets and credited at nominal value, provided the borrower does not have \\nany loans to Group companies on its own books.134\\nParticipations in investment companies that meet the conditions of Art. 82 para. 4 SO may be \\nincluded in the tied assets at net asset value (NAV).135\\nLoans to real estate companies in which an interest of more than 50% is held can be allocated \\nto restricted assets and recognized at nominal value, provided that liquidation of the company \\ncan be enforced and the borrower does not have any loans to Group companies on its own \\nbooks.136\\nParticipations in real estate companies in accordance with Art. 79 para. 1 let. f SO may be \\nincluded in the tied assets at NAV if the participation is more than 50% and liquidation can be \\nenforced.137\\nThis is intended to prevent intragroup investments whose value is doubtful in the event of \\nbankruptcy from being counted as tied assets. Double counting of investments (double \\ngearing) is also prevented.138\\nk) Credit ratings\\nThe following credit ratings are to be used for ordering tied assets: 139\\nCredit rating level 1: 140\\n\\n### Section: Page 20\\n20/70Highest grade, debtor with the highest credit rating. The debtor\\'s ability to meet its financial \\nobligations is outstanding. The default risk is virtually negligible, even in the longer term.\\nCredit rating level 2:\\nHigh grade, safe investment. The default risk is virtually negligible, but may be somewhat \\nmore difficult to assess in the longer term; the debtor\\'s ability to meet its financial obligations is \\nvery strong.141\\nCredit rating level 3:\\nUpper Medium grade. Safe investment, provided no unforeseen events affect the overall \\neconomy or industry. The borrower\\'s ability to meet its financial obligations is strong, but \\nsomewhat more vulnerable to the adverse effects of changes in external circumstances and \\neconomic conditions.142\\nCredit rating level 4:\\nLower Medium grade, average investment. However, problems are to be expected if the \\noverall economy deteriorates. The borrower\\'s ability to meet its financial obligations is \\nadequate, but more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.143\\nCredit rating level 5:\\nAll investments that do not meet the requirements for classification in one of the credit rating \\ncategories 1-4.144\\nFor regulatory purposes, the insurance company only uses ratings from recognized rating \\nagencies in accordance with FINMA Circular 2012/1 when assigning tied assets to the credit \\nrating categories\\n\"Rating agencies\" or own credit ratings.145\\nOwn credit ratings must meet the following requirements: 146\\n•They are created under our own responsibility according to comprehensible criteria. 147\\n•They represent the assessment of the default risk from the perspective of the insurance \\ncompany.148\\n•The sources of information used are scrutinized in terms of how they were obtained, their \\nobjectivity and their reliability.149\\n•They are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted if necessary. 150\\n•The processes for their creation and use are documented. 151\\n\\n### Section: Page 21\\n21/70The outsourcing of the process must be reported to FINMA in accordance with Art. 4 para. 2 \\nlet. j ISA. The insurance company remains responsible for the quality of the credit \\nassessments.152\\nG. Safekeeping of assets\\na) Self-custody\\nThe movable assets allocated to the tied assets may be held in custody by the insurance \\ncompany or the Swiss branch (Art. 86 para. 1 SO). The insurance company must notify \\nFINMA of the assets in its own custody and the exact place of custody (address, room \\nnumber, safe deposit box, etc.).153\\nb) Third-party custody\\nThird-party custody is permitted if the custodian in Switzerland is liable to the insurance \\nundertaking for the fulfillment of the custodian obligations (Art. 87 para. 2 SO). For this \\npurpose, the insurance company and the custodian must sign the \"Supplementary \\nAgreement\" (see Appendix) for each business relationship (custody accounts/accounts). The \\nassets in third-party custody, the custodian, the place of custody and the depositary as well as \\nthe corresponding changes must be reported to FINMA. A copy of the supplementary \\nagreement must be submitted at the same time.154\\nAssets held in custody are eligible for inclusion in tied assets as soon as the formal \\nrequirements have been met and FINMA has been notified.155\\nc) Custody abroad\\nOwn or third-party safe custody abroad is permitted if the foreign bankruptcy law guarantees \\nthe priority privilege of tied assets under Swiss law (Art. 87 para. 3 SO). The insurance \\ncompany must ensure that this requirement is met in the case of safe custody abroad.156\\nIn the case of safe custody abroad, the insurance undertaking must prove with an official \\nconfirmation or a well-founded legal opinion that the conditions set out in margin no. 156 are \\nmet.157\\nd) Type of custody\\nThe assets allocated to the tied assets must be kept separately from the other assets of the \\ninsurance company and must be designated as tied assets. The accounts and custody \\naccounts must be identified as belonging to the tied assets and with the specific designation of \\nthe tied assets.\\ncharacterize.158\\n\\n### Section: Page 22\\n22/70Custody as intermediated securities is permitted. 159\\nH. Receivables of non-life insurers from reinsurers\\na) Principles\\nThe reinsured portions of the provisions are offset against the tied assets of the non-life \\ninsurance companies in accordance with Art. 68 Para. 2 AVO.160\\nThe applications for offsetting the reinsured portions of the provisions and their approvals \\nrelate to the reinsurance companies and not to the amount of the reinsured portions. If \\noffsetting has been approved in relation to a reinsurer, the current amount of the reinsured \\nportions can be offset, subject to compliance with the limits in accordance with margin nos. \\n162-169. Offsetting of the reinsured portions of the provisions against a reinsurer can be \\napplied for as soon as a corresponding reinsurance contract exists, regardless of whether \\nreinsured portions of the provisions already exist.161\\nb) Crediting and limits\\nThe reinsured portions of the provisions are generally credited at 100% of the amount of the \\ncurrent portion; for reinsurers in run-off, at 75% of the amount of the current portion. In any \\ncase, the offsetting is limited as follows in accordance with the credit rating levels under \\nmargin nos. 139-144:162\\n•If the reinsurer\\'s credit rating is 2 or better: 20% of the target amount of the bundled \\nassets.163\\n•For credit rating level 3 of the reinsurer: 10% of the target amount of the tied assets. 164\\n•For credit rating level 4 of the reinsurer: 5% of the target amount of the tied assets. 165\\n•In the case of reinsurers with a credit rating of 5, the reinsured portions of the provisions \\ncannot be offset against the tied assets.166\\nThese limits are reduced by 50% for reinsured portions of the provisions from contracts with \\ninsurers that belong to the same group as the insurance company.167\\nWhen offsetting reinsured portions of provisions relating to several reinsurers belonging to the \\nsame group, the total of the offsets is limited to 1.5 times the limits (margin no. 162-166) \\n(based on the group\\'s credit quality step).\\nlimited.168\\n\\n### Section: Page 23\\n23/70FINMA may, upon request, approve offsetting beyond the stated limits, provided this does not \\nimpair the security of the tied assets.169\\nc) Special reinsurance relationships\\nReinsured portions of the provisions relating to the Swiss natural hazard pool can be credited \\nup to 10% of the target amount of the tied assets in each case.170\\nd) Application and approval procedure\\nThe form prescribed by FINMA must be used for the applications. If reinsurance contracts are \\nconcluded with branches of reinsurers, the name and registered office of the company\\'s head \\noffice must be stated on the form.171\\nIn justified cases, FINMA may limit the duration of approvals, in particular approvals in \\naccordance with margin no. 169.172\\nApplications are deemed to have been approved unless FINMA initiates a review within four \\nweeks.173\\nIf the conditions change, in particular the assessment of the creditworthiness of an approved \\nreinsurer, the crediting must be adjusted in accordance with the limits set out in margin nos. \\n162-166 and FINMA must be notified immediately.174\\nIf a further reinsurer is to be approved in addition to those already approved, all reinsurers \\nmust be listed in the application. Those not yet approved must be marked.175\\nI. Authorizations pursuant to Art. 79 para. 3 AVO\\nFINMA may, on request, allow further assets to be included in the tied assets, provided this \\ndoes not impair the security of the tied assets (Art. 79 para. 3 SO). FINMA bases its \\nassessment of these applications in particular on margin nos. 23-159 of this Circular.176\\nJ. Reporting to FINMA\\nWithin three months of the end of the financial year, the insurance company shall inform the \\naudit company of the target amount calculated at the end of the financial year for each tied \\nasset together with the list of cover assets. Reporting to FINMA takes place within four months \\nof the end of the financial year (Art. 72 para. 1 SO).177\\nInsurance companies domiciled in Switzerland must also report on every foreign insurance \\nportfolio for which they have to provide security abroad.178\\n\\n### Section: Page 24\\n24/70FINMA defines the requirements and the process for reporting tied assets on an annual basis. 179\\nIV. forms of investment in tied assets\\nIn addition to the general principles listed above, the following principles apply to the systems. 180\\nA. Cash deposits\\na) Permissible values\\nCash and cash deposits, namely bank balances as well as fixed-term deposits and other \\nmoney market investments are permitted. Other money market investments include short-term \\nmoney market investments with a term of up to 12 months.181\\nb) Special requirements\\nThe supplementary agreement in accordance with margin no. 154 must also be signed with \\nthe counterparty for cash deposits or account balances. In particular, the supplementary \\nagreement must exclude any lien, right of retention, right of set-off or similar right on the part \\nof the debtor.182\\nIn the case of claims against a debtor domiciled abroad, margin no. 132 must be observed. 183\\nc) Evaluation\\nInvestments in this category are valued at no more than their nominal value, taking into account \\nthe security and income (Art. 93 para. 2 SO).184\\nMoney market debt register claims are recognized at no more than market value. If they are not \\nlisted on a stock exchange, a standard market valuation method must be applied.185\\nB. Bonds, convertible bonds\\na) Permissible values\\nThe following values are assigned to this category:\\n•Government bonds\\n•Bonds issued by cantons, cities or municipalities and other public corporations\\n•Bonds issued by supranational organizations186\\n\\n### Section: Page 25\\n25/70•Pfandbriefe regulated by special legislation (covered bonds)\\n•Corporate bonds (banks, finance companies and other corporate bonds)\\n•Medium-term notes issued by a bank licensed in Switzerland\\nThe following types of bonds are also permitted:\\n•Convertible bonds with bond character and bonds with warrants\\n•Replicated bonds in accordance with margin nos. 422-431187\\nConvertible bonds are divided into convertible bonds with the character of bonds and \\nconvertible bonds with the character of shares. If the market value of the convertible bond is \\nhigher than 130% of the nominal value, it can be assigned to the \"shares\" category (Art. 79 \\npara. 1 let. e AVO). If the market value of the convertible bond subsequently falls below 130% \\nof the nominal value, the convertible bond remains in the \"shares\" category. Convertible \\nbonds that must be converted into shares (e.g. mandatory convertible bonds, mandatory \\nconvertible bonds, contingent convertible bonds [CoCo bonds]) are assigned to the \"shares\" \\ncategory.188\\nWith regard to bonds from foreign issuers, margin no. 132 must be observed. 189\\nb)Non-permissible values\\nInvestments that are issued as bonds but are assigned to another investment category in this \\ncircular due to their characteristics are not assignable. Examples of this are bonds issued by a \\nspecial purpose vehicle (SPV) for the purpose of risk transfer and securitized receivables \\n(ABS, CDOs, etc.).190\\nInsurance-linked securities (e.g. cat bonds) are assigned to the category \"Structured products\" \\n(margin no. 197).191\\nBonds with a conditional debt waiver (write-off bonds) cannot be allocated to restricted assets. 192\\nc) Evaluation\\nThe maximum imputed value is determined according to the scientific or straight-line cost \\namortization method plus accrued interest (Art. 88 para. 1 and Art. 88a AVO).193\\nWith the scientific cost amortization method, the difference between the acquisition value and \\nthe redemption value must be written down or written up over the remaining term of the \\nsecurity on the balance sheet date to such an extent that the initial internal rate of return (yield \\nto maturity) can be maintained. The acquisition cost excluding accrued interest (clean price) \\nmust be used (Art. 89 para. 1 AVO).194\\nUnder the straight-line cost amortization method, the difference between the acquisition value \\nand the repayment value is amortized in equal amounts as of the balance sheet date.195\\n\\n### Section: Page 26\\n26/70or as a revaluation over the remaining term. This method must also use the acquisition costs \\nexcluding accrued interest (Art. 89 para. 2 AVO).\\nConvertible bonds, which fall into the category of bonds in accordance with margin no. 188, can \\nbe accounted for using the cost amortization method.196\\nC. Structured products\\na) Definition\\nStructured products are investments in the form of a bond or debenture in which a cash \\ninstrument (e.g. a fixed-interest security) is firmly linked to one or more derivative financial \\ninstruments to form a legal and economic unit. The derivative financial instruments refer to \\nunderlying assets (e.g. shares, bonds, interest rates, exchange rates, alternative \\ninvestments).197\\nb) Permissible values\\nThe admissibility of structured products is subject to the following conditions: 198\\n•The individual components (e.g. cash instrument and derivative) must meet the \\nrequirements of the corresponding category of tied assets.199\\n•The structured product may not give rise to any delivery or purchase obligations. 200\\n•There must be no additional funding obligations. 201\\nc) Crediting and valuation\\nThe structured products are valued according to one of the following methods and included in \\nthe tied assets. The selected procedure must be maintained until the structured product is \\nsold or redeemed.202\\n1. structured product as a whole (overall view)\\nThe structured product is measured as a whole at fair value. 203\\nThe structured product as a whole is only allocated to one category of tied assets in \\naccordance with the embedded risks and is subject to all the provisions of the \\ncorresponding category.204\\nFor example, an index certificate consisting of a money market investment and long futures \\non an equity index can be allocated as a whole to the \"equities\" category at market value.205\\n\\n### Section: Page 27\\n27/70If the structured product contains various embedded risks, it is assigned as a whole to the \\ncategory with the highest requirements for allocation and recognition.206\\nFor example, a cash instrument combined with various derivatives that participate in both \\nequity and commodity indices are allocated as a whole to the \"alternative investments\" \\ncategory.207\\n2. decomposition of the structured product into its individual components\\nIf the structured product is broken down into eligible components, the individual \\ncomponents of the corresponding investment category are taken into account. The \\nprovisions of the respective investment category must be observed with regard to \\nvaluation and inclusion in the tied assets.208\\nFor example, a zero bond combined with a long call option can be split into the \"bonds\" \\nand \"derivatives\" categories. The zero bond is valued at amortized cost, the option is used \\nat market value.209\\nd) Special requirements\\nThe provisions relating to foreign counterparties must be taken into account (margin no. 132). 210\\nInvestments in insurance-linked securities are permitted insofar as these investments or the \\nresulting risks are not positively correlated with the company\\'s own insurance risk.211\\ne) Limitations\\nFor structured products or individual elements of structured products (when broken down), the \\nlimitations of the categories to which they are assigned in accordance with margin no. 199 \\napply.212\\nf) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance companies that invest in structured products must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, an appropriate\\nrisk management and an adequate system infrastructure (margin no. 76).213\\n\\n### Section: Page 28\\n28/70D. Securitized receivables\\na) Definition\\nSecuritized receivables are risk transfer instruments that transfer the credit risk from the \\nassets transferred to a pool of receivables to the buyers of the securitized receivable. The \\nsecuritized receivable can be divided into several tranches (senior, junior, equity tranche). The \\npool of receivables can have a uniform or mixed composition and consist of physical or \\nsynthetic (structured) receivables. Examples of securitized receivables are Asset Backed \\nSecurities (ABS), Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS, RMBS, CMBS) and Collateralized Debt \\nObligations (CDO, CBO, CLO, CMO, SFCDO).214\\nb) Permissible values\\nOnly investments in securitized receivables that can be assessed by the insurance company \\nin terms of transparency, degree of complexity, recoverability (valuation) and risk are \\npermitted.215\\nc)Non-permissible values\\nThe following values in particular are not permitted: 216\\n•Intragroup transactions with securitized receivables (margin no. 133-138). 217\\n•Investments in the high-risk tranches of a securitized receivable, i.e. in particular in the \\nequity tranche, junior tranches and mezzanine tranches. Investments in higher tranches \\n(senior tranches, super-senior tranches) are also excluded if, taking into account all \\nrelevant aspects, they do not correspond to an investment with at least credit quality step \\n4. This assessment must not be based on external credit enhancements (e.g. guarantees, \\npledges). The assessment of the underlying assets is therefore relevant. Structure-related \\ncredit enhancements (e.g. excess spread, reserve account, overcollateralization) may be \\nincluded in the analysis. The assessment process must meet the requirements of margin \\nnos. 221-224.218\\n•Investments in securitized receivables whose receivables pool is actively managed \\n(managed CDO), if this restricts the insurance company in its assessment of the risks and \\nrecoverability of the receivables pool. If the investment restrictions and the management of \\nthe receivables pool are designed in such a way that the insurance company can promptly \\ntrack changes in the composition and determine the effects on the risks and recoverability, \\ninvestments in managed CDOs are permitted.219\\n•CDOs of CDOs and similar nested structures. 220\\n\\n### Section: Page 29\\n29/70d) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance undertakings that invest in securitized receivables must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (margin no. 76).221\\nThe insurance company must analyze and understand the risks of securitized receivables. If \\nthird parties are involved in the analysis, any conflicts of interest must be clarified in advance. \\nThe underlying pool of receivables must be analyzed with regard to its composition and \\nrecoverability (assumptions about the distribution of default probabilities, recovery rates). In \\norder to make an assessment of the performance of a securitized receivable, it is therefore \\nnecessary to have knowledge of the markets underlying the assets in the receivables pool. It \\nmust also be taken into account whether the pool of receivables is physically present or has \\nbeen created synthetically (e.g. with the help of credit default swaps), whether the \\nsecuritization relates to cash flows or market values, whether the pool of receivables is fixed \\nor is actively restructured, etc. A close examination of the structure is essential to determine \\nthe recoverability and risk of the securitized receivable. The analysis of the structure of the \\nsecuritized receivable usually requires a breakdown into the individual stages of the \\nsecuritization. At each stage, the risks and the built-in hedging measures must be closely \\nscrutinized with regard to their effect.222\\nThe volume ratios of the purchased tranche and the portfolio covering this tranche \\n(subordination), the size of the subordinated tranches and the waterfall structure must be \\nexamined in detail.223\\nThe insurance company establishes a due diligence process that guarantees a \\ncomprehensive and in-depth analysis of the structure, underlying risks and general conditions \\nof the securitized receivable. This review is intended to ensure that the investment is only \\nmade in securitized receivables whose value and risks can be tracked at all times and which \\ncomply with the insurance company\\'s risk policy.224\\ne) Limitations\\nThe investment in securitized receivables is limited to 10% of the target amount. The imputed \\nvalue per investment may not exceed 1% of the target amount.225\\nf) Evaluation\\nThe securitized receivables are recognized at no more than their market value. When \\ndetermining the value, the quality of the valuation (e.g. with regard to the liquidity of the \\nsecuritized asset) must also be taken into account.\\nmarket) are reviewed.226\\n\\n### Section: Page 30\\n30/70E. Other acknowledgements of debt\\na) Permissible values\\nPromissory note loans granted to the following borrowers may be included in this investment \\ncategory:227\\n•Swiss public corporations; 228\\n•Banks domiciled in Switzerland; 229\\n•Other debtors domiciled in Switzerland who have a credit rating of at least level 3. 230\\nThe allocation of other promissory note loans to tied assets must be approved in advance by \\nFINMA.231\\nb)Non-permissible values\\nIn particular, the following recognitions of debt may not be included in tied assets: 232\\n•Loans to private equity companies (these are to be treated as alternative investments in \\naccordance with Art. 79 para. 1 let. h SO);233\\n•Policy loans; 234\\n•Loans to Group companies (see notes 133-138); 235\\n•Guarantees, letters of credit, etc. 236\\nc) Special requirements\\nThere must be a written, legally valid acknowledgement of debt. 237\\nThe debtor must expressly waive all rights of set-off, retention and similar rights (margin no. 38). 238\\nd) Evaluation\\nThe loan is measured at nominal value, taking into account the recoverability of the loan (see \\nnote 125).239\\n\\n### Section: Page 31\\n31/70F.

Alternative investments\\na) Definition\\nAlternative investments can be summarized as investment opportunities that go beyond \\ntraditional investments. They are characterized by their alternative investment character, i.e. \\nmore flexible investment options such as short selling, borrowing, the use of more complex \\nstrategies and investments in less liquid assets. In general, alternative investments are \\nsubject to less supervision and often have lower liquidity and transparency.317\\nAlternative systems give the insurance company the opportunity to\\ndiversify the investment portfolio more broadly.318\\nDue to the special features, the general principles of tied assets only apply to alternative \\ninvestments to a limited extent. Alternative investments do not have to be securitized, have a \\nliquid market or be subject to effective supervision.319\\nb) Permissible values\\naa) Permissible investment universe\\nThe following sub-categories are allocated to alternative investments:\\n•Hedge funds\\n•Private equity320\\n\\n### Section: Page 40\\n40/70•Private debt, incl. senior secured loans\\n•Commodities, incl. gold\\nInvestments in infrastructure can be made in the alternative investments investment category \\nin the form of private equity and/or private debt. Infrastructure investments can also be \\nallocated to tied assets in other investment categories if the corresponding conditions are met.321\\nbb) Structure of the systems\\nInvestments in fund solutions are permitted. Investments in the listed sub-categories may be \\nmade with collective investment schemes pursuant to Art. 71 CISA (other funds for alternative \\ninvestments) and foreign (on- and offshore) fund structures.322\\nInvestments based on indices, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets are permitted, \\nprovided the investments are broadly diversified and highly liquid. Transparency with regard to \\nthe underlying regulatory system of the investment must be guaranteed so that the special \\nrequirements mentioned in margin nos. 334-342 can also be fulfilled analogously for these \\ninvestments.323\\nStructured products linked to alternative investments are permitted. 324\\nGold bars that comply with the Good Delivery Rules of the London Bullion Market Association \\nmay be allocated to the tied assets. The gold bars must be kept separately for each tied asset \\nin the case of own or third-party custody and must be identifiable via the manufacturer, the \\nserial number and the year of melting.325\\nInvestments in other investment structures must be applied for and approved in advance by \\nFINMA. The insurance company must prove to FINMA that all the provisions listed in margin \\nnos. 317-350 are fully complied with.326\\ncc) Special properties\\nIn order to be allocated to tied assets, the alternative investments must have the following \\ncharacteristics:327\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Convertible bonds that must be converted \\ninto shares (e.g. mandatory convertible bond, mandatory convertible) are assigned to this \\ncategory. CoCo bonds are treated in the same way as mandatory convertible bonds.242\\nb)Non-permissible values\\nNon-traded shares and shares in affiliated companies are not permitted investments in tied \\nassets (see also margin nos. 133-138).243\\nc) Limitations\\nA maximum of 30% of the target amount of the tied assets may be invested in shares and other \\nequity securities.244\\nd) Evaluation\\nEquity securities and convertible bonds with the character of shares are counted at market value \\nat most (Art. 93 para. 1 and 88 para. 2 AVO).245\\nG. Real estate\\na) Permissible values\\nTied assets include properties that are easily realizable and whose valuation is subject to little \\nuncertainty.246\\naa) Direct investment in real estate: types of buildings\\nThe following types of buildings in the sole ownership of the insurance company can be \\nassigned:247\\n\\n### Section: Page 32\\n32/70•Residential buildings: single-family homes, apartment buildings and condominiums; 248\\n•Commercial buildings: Office and administration buildings; 249\\n•Mixed-use properties: properties with residential and commercial building shares in \\naccordance with margin nos. 248 and 249, regardless of the amount of the shares;250\\n•Mixed-use properties with non-chargeable portion. 251\\nProperties which, in addition to a residential or commercial building share, have a non-\\nassignable use in accordance with margin no. 258 can be fully credited based on the total net \\nrent of the entire property if the creditable portion is at least 70 %.252\\nProperties with a sales area share of more than 30 % of the net rent can be counted if they are \\nlocated in an urban center.253\\nbb) Building law\\nIf the insurance company is the grantor of building rights, an allocation can be made if\\n•the building right is recorded in the land register;\\n•the building lease generates a regular, long-term, contractually secured income;\\n•the creditworthiness of the building leaseholder is good; and\\n•the property only includes permitted buildings (margin no. 247-253).254\\nIf the insurance company is the building leaseholder, an allocation can be made if\\n•the building is recorded in the land register under building rights; and\\n•the building is permitted under building law (margin nos. 247-253).255\\ncc) Real estate companies\\nInvestments in companies whose sole business purpose is the acquisition, sale, rental and \\nleasing of their own residential and commercial properties, provided that more than 50% of all \\nshares are held and liquidation under company law (Art. 736 para. 2 CO) can be enforced.256\\nb)Non-permissible values\\nProperties that are difficult to sell or whose valuation is subject to great uncertainty cannot be \\nallocated to restricted assets.257\\nFor example, the following objects do not meet the criteria set out in margin no. 246: 258\\n\\n### Section: Page 33\\n33/70•Building land (a plot of land on which a new building is being constructed that can be \\nallocated in accordance with margin nos. 247-253 can, however, be taken into account)\\n•Buildings in progress\\n•Production facilities, warehouses, distribution centers\\n•Sports facilities\\n•Shopping centers, provided they are not located in urban centers\\n•Hotels, restaurants\\n•Retirement and nursing homes and senior residences\\n•Schools\\n•Collector\\'s and luxury properties, vacation apartments or houses\\n•Co-owned properties\\n•properties in need of remediation with contaminated sites in accordance with the \\nContaminated Sites Ordinance (Art. 2 AltlV; SR 814.680)\\n•Properties from forced sale (if the insurance company has taken over the property as \\nmortgagee)\\nThe following are also not permitted: 259\\n•Real estate abroad - irrespective of whether it is held directly or indirectly in an investment \\ncompany in accordance with margin no. 256.260\\n•All properties that were encumbered for the purpose of mortgaging. 261\\nIn justified cases, an exception may be granted upon request, such as in the case of 262\\n•Retirement and nursing homes, senior residences\\nThe potential for conversion must be demonstrated and the costs must be quantified and \\nincluded in the valuation. The value after conversion minus the conversion costs is eligible.263\\n•Properties from forced sale\\nDetails of the assessment and plausibility check must be submitted with the application.264\\n•Properties with contaminated sites\\nThe technical report on the expected renovation costs must be included in the \\nassessment. Both must be submitted with the application.\\nIf there are guarantees that the polluter or the public authorities will bear the entire \\nremediation costs, these must be submitted with the application for an exemption permit.265\\n\\n### Section: Page 34\\n34/70c) Limitations\\nThe crediting of real estate is limited to 25% of the debit amount. 266\\nThe crediting of an individual object may not amount to more than 5% of the target amount. 267\\nThe deduction of real estate and mortgages is limited to a total of 35% of the debit amount. 268\\nWhen calculating this limit, shares in real estate companies (see also margin no. 256), real \\nestate funds and other instruments that increase or reduce the real estate exposure must be \\nincluded.269\\nd) Evaluation\\naa) General principles\\nReal estate may be included in tied assets at a maximum of market value. 270\\nThe market value is the amount for which the property could be sold or purchased between \\nknowledgeable, willing parties in an arm\\'s length transaction in the ordinary course of \\nbusiness.271\\nThe insurance company determines the market value of all properties and land on an annual \\nbasis. The principles of individual valuation and valuation continuity must be observed.272\\nThe principle of individual valuation means that each property in a real estate portfolio is valued \\nat its individual market value.273\\nThe principle of valuation continuity means that the properties are divided into groups of \\ncomparable properties, taking into account the appropriate method for determining the market \\nvalue in each case, and that the respective valuation method is applied consistently and \\ncontinuously for each group.274\\nbb) Direct investments\\nThe market value of real estate can be estimated using the following valuation methods:\\n•Discounted cash flow method (DCF)\\n•Income capitalization method\\n•Hedonic method275\\nIt must be ensured that the valuation method used for each group of properties corresponds to \\nthe market value (margin nos. 270-274).276\\n\\n### Section: Page 35\\n35/70When using the hedonic method, it must be ensured that the hedonic estimate is based on \\nrecognized statistical methods and sound data.277\\nIf values determined and audited in accordance with IFRS / US GAAP or Swiss GAAP FER are \\navailable that correspond to a market value in accordance with margin nos. 270-274, these \\nvalues are to be used.278\\nAllowable building land parcels are to be counted at no more than the market value of the \\nbuilding land.279\\nIn special cases, FINMA may grant an exception upon reasoned request. 280\\ncc) Properties with building rights\\nThe market value of all building rights is to be determined uniformly using the same method. 281\\nWhen determining the market value of buildings under building law, the special circumstances \\nin connection with the building law must be taken into account.282\\ndd) Real estate companies\\nThe pro rata net asset value (NAV) is deemed to be the market value for investments of 50% \\nor more. When calculating the NAV, the properties held are valued as direct investments, \\ntaking into account any liabilities. Non-accountable properties are to be taken into account \\nwith a value of zero.283\\nee) Review of the valuation\\nAt least once every 10 years, all properties must be valued individually by a real estate valuer \\n(including an on-site inspection) to check the market values applied. The valuation is based on \\nthe appraiser\\'s professional expertise and is neutral. The dossier must be updated as part of \\nthe review.284\\nThe insurance company documents the review process and ensures that findings from the \\nreview estimates are included in the valuation of individual properties or the determination of \\nmodel parameters.285\\nIf the insurance company has a different concept for periodic valuation, it can be submitted to \\nFINMA for approval.286\\ne) Documentation\\nEvery insurance company must keep complete, up-to-date, comprehensible and verifiable \\ndossiers for the objects credited. They must allow an independent third party to verify the \\ncurrent status, the contractual basis, the income, any\\nand the basis for calculating the current valuation.287\\n\\n### Section: Page 36\\n36/70H. Mortgage receivables\\na) Permissible values\\nMortgage claims (mortgages) can be allocated to tied assets if the mortgage relates to a \\nproperty in accordance with margin nos. 247-253 or a permitted building under building rights \\n(see margin nos. 254 and 255).288\\nb)Non-permissible values\\nMortgages whose mortgage relates to non-assignable real estate are not assignable. \\nExceptions are governed by the provisions on real estate (margin nos. 257-258, 260).289\\nMortgages cannot be assigned to tied assets if they are subordinate to other claims secured \\nby mortgage. An exception exists in the case of subsequently registered statutory mortgages \\nand mortgages that are included in the same tied assets.290\\nc) Limitations\\nThe offsetting of mortgages is limited to 25% of the debit amount. 291\\nThe offsetting of an individual mortgage is limited to 5% of the debit amount. 292\\nThe deduction of real estate and mortgages is limited to a total of 35% of the debit amount. 293\\nd) Credit assessment and affordability\\nBefore granting a loan, the insurance company is obliged to carry out a credit check. This \\nincludes checking the creditworthiness of the debtor (creditworthiness and credit capacity) as \\nwell as assessing the collateral. These must be clearly and conclusively defined by the \\ninsurance company in internal regulations.294\\nThe basis for calculating affordability is the borrower\\'s sustainable income and expenditure in \\nthe case of owner-occupied residential property or income and cost components in the case of \\ninvestment properties. The assessments must be documented and kept for the term of the \\nmortgage.295\\nThe insurance company must ensure that the assessment of creditworthiness and affordability \\nis carried out systematically.296\\n\\n### Section: Page 37\\n37/70The insurance company defines the procedure in internal regulations. These stipulate how \\ncreditworthiness and affordability are to be verified and documented. They also specify the \\nlong-term imputed mortgage interest rate to be used and the corresponding maximum limits \\nfor the affordability calculation.297\\ne) Valuation of the mortgage\\nThe insurance company determines the market value of its mortgage collateral carefully, \\nsystematically and periodically in accordance with uniform principles and taking into account \\nall relevant information.298\\nIf the purchase price is higher than the market value, the market value is decisive. 299\\naa) Authorized investigation proceedings\\nThe market value of the mortgaged property is estimated by a real estate valuer. The \\nappraisal is based on the appraiser\\'s professional expertise and is neutral and independent of \\ninstructions.300\\nThe market value of the mortgaged property can be estimated as follows:\\n•Discounted cash flow method (DCF)\\n•Income capitalization method\\n•Hedonic method\\n•Practitioner method301\\nbb) Mortgages on properties with building rights\\nWhen determining the market value of properties with building rights, the special circumstances \\nmust be taken into account.302\\nf) Credit monitoring\\naa) Reassessment of creditworthiness and affordability\\nIf events relevant to creditworthiness become known, a new review must be carried out and \\nsuitable measures must be derived from this.303\\nbb) Monitoring and reviewing the market values of mortgaged properties\\nThe insurance company periodically (at least every 10 years in full) reviews the\\nMarket values of mortgaged properties with a loan-to-value ratio of over 20% or over CHF \\n100,000. The periodicity and methodology are based on objective criteria, which the304\\n\\n### Section: Page 38\\n38/70insurance company internally. The insurance company documents the review process internally.\\ng) Valuation and crediting\\naa) At nominal value\\nMortgages are valued and recognized at a maximum of their nominal value. 305\\nbb) Loan-to-value limits\\nFull crediting to the tied assets can be made for each property up to the following loan-to-value \\nlimits:306\\n•66 2/3 % of the market value of the mortgage for residential or commercial buildings in \\naccordance with margin nos. 248 and 249.307\\n•66 2/3 % of the market value of the mortgage for residential and commercial buildings with \\nmixed use in accordance with margin no. 250, provided that the non-allocable use (based \\non income value) is 30 % or lower.308\\n•66 2/3 % of the market value of the mortgage for mixed-use residential and commercial \\nbuildings in urban centers with a sales area share of more than 30 % of the net rent in \\naccordance with margin no. 253, whereby the increased credit risks of such properties \\nmust be taken into account.309\\n•80 % of the market value of the mortgage for residential buildings with a minimum \\nresidential share of 70 %, if a regular, standard market amortization has been agreed for \\nthe portion above 66 2/3 %. The amortization can also be indirect.310\\n•over 80 % of the market value of the mortgage for residential properties with a minimum \\nresidential share of 70 %, if additional collateral (e.g. pledged policies) is provided for the \\nportion above 80 % and, after deduction of the additional collateral, regular amortization at \\nmarket rates has been agreed for the portion above 66 2/3 %. The surrender values of the \\nadditional collateral must not be subject to negative fluctuations in value.311\\ncc) Adjusted imputed value\\nIf the senior and pari passu mortgages exceed the loan-to-value limits in accordance with \\nmargin nos. 306-311, the mortgage can only be partially offset up to the loan-to-value limit.312\\nIf the mortgage debtor is more than 7 months in arrears with the agreed interest and \\namortization payments, a corresponding value adjustment must be made.313\\n\\n### Section: Page 39\\n39/70In the event of a delay of more than 12 months, the corresponding mortgage is no longer \\neligible.314\\nh) documentation\\nThe credit relationship must be documented in a dossier in a complete, up-to-date, \\ncomprehensible and verifiable manner.  This applies to all documents on which t h e  granting, \\nmonitoring and renewal of the loan was based, i.e. both the relevant documents on the \\nborrower\\'s personal situation and information on the mortgage (incl. valuation method and \\nresult) must be available and accessible in the dossier.315\\nThe results of the review of the borrower\\'s creditworthiness and the periodic valuation of the \\nmortgage must be recorded. The documents must allow a third party to form a reliable opinion \\nabout the mortgage, the credit decision and credit monitoring.316\\nI. Alternative investments\\na) Definition\\nAlternative investments can be summarized as investment opportunities that go beyond \\ntraditional investments. They are characterized by their alternative investment character, i.e. \\nmore flexible investment options such as short selling, borrowing, the use of more complex \\nstrategies and investments in less liquid assets. In general, alternative investments are \\nsubject to less supervision and often have lower liquidity and transparency.317\\nAlternative systems give the insurance company the opportunity to\\ndiversify the investment portfolio more broadly.318\\nDue to the special features, the general principles of tied assets only apply to alternative \\ninvestments to a limited extent. Alternative investments do not have to be securitized, have a \\nliquid market or be subject to effective supervision.319\\nb) Permissible values\\naa) Permissible investment universe\\nThe following sub-categories are allocated to alternative investments:\\n•Hedge funds\\n•Private equity320\\n\\n### Section: Page 40\\n40/70•Private debt, incl. senior secured loans\\n•Commodities, incl. gold\\nInvestments in infrastructure can be made in the alternative investments investment category \\nin the form of private equity and/or private debt. Infrastructure investments can also be \\nallocated to tied assets in other investment categories if the corresponding conditions are met.321\\nbb) Structure of the systems\\nInvestments in fund solutions are permitted. Investments in the listed sub-categories may be \\nmade with collective investment schemes pursuant to Art. 71 CISA (other funds for alternative \\ninvestments) and foreign (on- and offshore) fund structures.322\\nInvestments based on indices, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets are permitted, \\nprovided the investments are broadly diversified and highly liquid. Transparency with regard to \\nthe underlying regulatory system of the investment must be guaranteed so that the special \\nrequirements mentioned in margin nos. 334-342 can also be fulfilled analogously for these \\ninvestments.323\\nStructured products linked to alternative investments are permitted. 324\\nGold bars that comply with the Good Delivery Rules of the London Bullion Market Association \\nmay be allocated to the tied assets. The gold bars must be kept separately for each tied asset \\nin the case of own or third-party custody and must be identifiable via the manufacturer, the \\nserial number and the year of melting.325\\nInvestments in other investment structures must be applied for and approved in advance by \\nFINMA. The insurance company must prove to FINMA that all the provisions listed in margin \\nnos. 317-350 are fully complied with.326\\ncc) Special properties\\nIn order to be allocated to tied assets, the alternative investments must have the following \\ncharacteristics:327\\n•Investments in alternative investments can be made under the subcategories listed in \\nmargin no. 320. The individual sub-categories must be diversified in themselves, with the \\nexception of investments in gold.328\\n•An exit from the individual alternative investments is possible within the usual market \\nperiods and within a maximum of 24 months. Longer periods are permitted for \\ninvestments in private equity and private debt. However, care must be taken to ensure \\nthat the commitments entered into are taken into account in the liquidity planning so that \\nsufficient liquidity is available at all times.\\nliquidity is available.329\\n\\n### Section: Page 41\\n41/70•The insurance company may not incur any additional funding obligations or other liabilities \\nfrom the investment in alternative investments. This also applies in the event of \\ninsolvency. The possibility of offsetting against debts of the insurance company must also \\nbe excluded. Commitments that are contractually entered into and limited in amount do not \\ncount as additional funding obligations.330\\nc)Non-permissible values\\nInvestments in other (traditional) investment categories without an alternative investment \\ncharacter or investments that do not meet the criteria of this Circular cannot be allocated to \\nthe tied assets as alternative investments.331\\nDirect investments (e.g. in individual private equity or infrastructure companies) cannot be \\nallocated.332\\nPhysical investments in commodities are not permitted, with the exception of gold. 333\\nd) Special requirements\\naa) Concept for alternative investments\\nAny insurance company wishing to invest in alternative investments must submit a concept for \\nalternative investments to FINMA in advance, showing how the provisions and requirements \\nof this Circular will be met.334\\nThe insurance company must define in the concept which alternative investments are made. 335\\nMaterial changes to a concept that has already been submitted must be reported to FINMA before \\nthe internal directives by means of which the concept is implemented internally enter into force.336\\nbb) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance companies that invest in alternative investments must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (see margin no. 76).337\\nInvestments in single funds require higher standards in terms of organization, know-how and \\ninvestment process than investments in diversified fund of funds structures.338\\ncc) Due diligence\\nInvestments in specialized investment managers, such as hedge funds and private equity, \\nrequire a comprehensive and in-depth review. The review process includes a339\\n\\n### Section: Page 42\\n42/70investment-specific and operational due diligence. The insurance company conducts a \\nstructured survey of the investment manager and assesses the documentation of the product \\nand the risks. A due diligence report summarizes the findings and results. A due diligence \\nquestionnaire is generally not sufficient for this.\\nThe insurance company has quantitative analysis tools and a documented due diligence \\nconcept to ensure that both the selection and the ongoing monitoring of the investment are \\ncarried out in accordance with recognized and proven standards.340\\nIt must be ensured that the conditions specified in margin nos. 317-350 can actually be met. 341\\nDue diligence can also be carried out by external specialists. 342\\ne) Limitations\\nThe following limits apply to this investment category: 343\\n•The value of all alternative investments included in the tied assets may not exceed 15% of \\nthe target amount.344\\n•The imputed value per subcategory (margin no. 320) may not exceed 10% of the target \\namount.345\\n•The imputed value per fund of funds may not exceed 5% of the target amount. 346\\n•For all other investments, the imputed value per investment may not exceed 1% of the \\ntarget amount. This limit does not apply to physical gold.347\\nCare must be taken to ensure that commitments made in subsequent years do not lead to these \\nlimits being exceeded.348\\nf) Evaluation\\nPursuant to Art. 93 para. 1 SO, alternative investments are recognized at no more than \\nmarket value. It must be ensured that the insurance company receives net asset values (NAV) \\nfor hedge funds on at least a monthly basis and for private equity and private debt on a \\nquarterly basis.349\\ng) Foreign assets\\nThe general provisions on foreign assets (margin no. 132) do not have to be complied with for \\ninvestments in alternative investments.350\\n\\n### Section: Page 43\\n43/70J. Derivative financial instruments\\na) General provisions on the permissible values\\naa) Permitted derivatives\\nAccording to Art. 79 SO, derivatives are permitted in tied assets if 351\\n•the underlying assets on which the derivatives are based are permitted as investments in \\naccordance with Art. 79 (1) SO.352\\nPermissible underlying assets for derivatives in tied assets include not only direct \\ninvestments (e.g. equities or receivables), but also assets that track indices or interest \\nrates. The condition that the underlying asset on which the derivative is based must be \\npermissible for the tied assets must also be met for index transactions.353\\nCredit default swaps (CDS) are only permitted as part of tied assets for the strategies \\ndefined in margin nos. 373-446. Other credit derivatives may not be allocated to tied \\nassets. The market liquidity of the respective CDS must be checked before it is used and \\nthroughout its term.354\\n•they do not have a leverage effect on the tied assets, subject to the provisions of Art. 79 \\npara. 2 SO.355\\nA leverage effect occurs when the relative change in value of the derivative is greater than \\nthe relative change in value of the underlying.356\\nDerivatives must be covered by liquidity or existing underlying assets in order to prevent the \\nfinancial impact of leverage effects on tied assets.357\\nA negative leverage effect on the tied assets must be ruled out,\\ni.e. any sale of the bond used as cover must not lead to a shortfall in the target amount of \\nthe tied assets.358\\n•they comply with the principles formulated in margin no. 3-22. 359\\nbb) Permitted combinations\\nIt is permissible to combine several basic forms of derivatives that are based on the same \\nunderlying instrument(s). The following conditions apply:360\\n•The various components of the combination must be broken down and evaluated \\nseparately.361\\n\\n### Section: Page 44\\n44/70•It must be possible to allocate the individual components of the combination - after they \\nhave been broken down - to one of the strategies mentioned below (margin nos. 373-\\n446).362\\n•The coverage obligation pursuant to margin no. 5-17 must be complied with. 363\\ncc)Non-permissible values and transactions\\nThe following derivative transactions and transactions may not be allocated to tied assets: 364\\n•Derivatives that are not covered by underlying assets or liquidity. 365\\n•Derivatives that are derived from an inadmissible underlying pursuant to Art. 79 para. 1 \\nSO.366\\n•Short sales, i.e. forward sales of underlying assets without owning them when the contract \\nis concluded.367\\n•Transactions that have an overall leverage effect on the tied assets, subject to the \\nprovisions of Art. 79 para. 2 SO.368\\ndd) Attribution of exposures to limits of the underlyings\\nDerivatives must be taken into account in the limits for the corresponding underlying assets. \\nThe limits for derivative transactions must be complied with cumulatively with the other limits \\nfor tied assets.369\\nee) Evaluation\\nDerivative financial instruments may be included in tied assets at no more than their market \\nvalue. For exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs), the market value is the exchange value; for \\nover-the-counter derivatives (OTC derivatives), the market value is the value at which an open \\nderivative position can be closed out again (closing out). The positive or negative replacement \\nvalue is therefore added to the tied assets.370\\nIf no current prices are available for derivatives or if no market prices are available for OTC \\nderivatives, they must be valued using valuation models that are appropriate and recognized \\nin practice based on the market values of the underlying assets from which the derivatives are \\nderived. The valuations must be documented and comprehensible at all times.371\\nThe recognized position of the derivative and the underlying must correspond to the actual \\nposition at all times.\\nvalue of the position: In the case of short call options, for example, at least the negative value of \\nthe derivative i s  deducted from the underlying. The combination of372\\n\\n### Section: Page 45\\n45/70The maximum amount of the underlying security that may be included in the tied assets is the \\nexercise or strike price.\\nb) Derivatives for hedging asset portfolios\\naa) Permitted derivatives\\nThe hedging strategy serves to reduce or eliminate the risks to the value of the assets \\nresulting from price fluctuations, insolvency or currency fluctuations.373\\nDerivative instruments for hedging purposes are only permitted if they fulfill the following \\nconditions:374\\n•The hedged underlying is included in the tied assets. 375\\n•The obligations entered into are covered at all times by the underlying assets in the tied \\nassets.376\\n•The fluctuations in the market are tracked by recognizing the underlying in the combined \\nassets. For derivatives related to interest rate risk and credit risk, see margin nos. 386-\\n399 and margin nos. 400-405.377\\n•The hedging instrument used enables effective hedging of the market value of the \\nunderlying, i.e. the absolute change in the market value of the underlying is compensated \\nfor by the absolute change in the price of the hedging instrument. No short positions (short \\nsales) may be built up through the use of derivatives on a net basis, i.e. after offsetting the \\nunderlying and derivative holdings (there must be no overhedge).378\\n•The instruments used have no leverage effect on the tied assets. 379\\nThe following instruments, which can be used to effectively hedge a downside exposure, are \\npermitted:\\n•Long put options\\n•Short futures\\n•Short forwards\\n•Swaps380\\nThis category does not include instruments that are used to finance the hedge but do not \\nthemselves constitute an effective hedge, such as short call options (see margin nos. 438-\\n442).381\\nStrategies that constitute hedging in their entirety (e.g. risk reversals, put spreads) can be \\nallocated provided the following conditions are met:382\\n\\n### Section: Page 46\\n46/70•The underlying asset of the long and short option is identical;\\n•The term of the short options is shorter than or equal to that of the long put (hedging) \\noptions;\\n•The net position from the underlying instrument and the hedging strategy may not lead to \\na net short position at any time;\\n•The counterparties to the strategy\\'s options transactions are identical and the transactions \\nare subject to the same netting agreement.\\nDerivatives on indices (e.g. short SMI futures, long SMI put options) can also be counted as \\nhedging tied assets. It should be noted that the structure of the hedged portfolio of assets \\nessentially corresponds to the structure of the index and that the returns of the portfolio \\ncorrelate closely with the returns of the index. The hedged positions should therefore largely \\ncorrelate with the index.383\\nForeign currency hedging via a third currency (proxy hedge) is not recognized as hedging. \\nHowever, if the insurance company documents any proxy hedge concluded internally and can \\nplausibly demonstrate that there is an intention to hedge, the derivative can be allocated to tied \\nassets as an asset in the corresponding category of the reference currency.384\\nbb) Limitations\\nThere are no limits for derivatives used to hedge assets in accordance with margin nos. 373-\\n405.385\\ncc) Derivatives to hedge interest rate risk\\nInterest rate hedges for bonds that are valued using the cost amortization method cannot be \\nallocated to this strategy, as they do not meet the condition relating to the tracking of market \\nfluctuations (margin no. 377). If, in such cases, the interest rate derivatives are nevertheless \\nmanaged under the same master agreement (see margin nos. 447-465) of the tied assets, the \\nprocedure under margin nos. 387-399 must be selected:386\\nAccording to Art. 88 and 89 AVO, a fixed-interest security can be credited at a maximum of \\nthe value determined using the cost amortization method. The acquisition value of the security \\nis written down or written up to the redemption value over the remaining term.

Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due during the loan are due to the lending insurance company. As \\nthe beneficial owner, the insurance company bears the risks of fluctuations in the securities \\nand takes these into account in the\\nThe securities that have been lent are counted as tied assets.507\\n\\n### Section: Page 60\\n60/70b) Permitted transactions\\naa) General conditions\\nSecurities lending is only possible under the following conditions: 508\\n•Framework agreement\\nThe insurance company concludes a framework agreement with the counterparty to the \\nsecurities lending transaction (margin nos. 519-523).509\\n•Counterparty / Borrower\\nThe insurance company only engages in securities lending with first-class supervised \\nborrowers that are professionally active in this type of business and with authorized and \\nrecognized central counterparties and central securities depositories that guarantee the \\nproper execution of securities lending.510\\n•Requirements for processing\\n•The transaction is processed promptly (step by step if possible).\\n•All open positions are valued at least once a day (mark-to-market).\\n•Net exposures are balanced with margin calls at least once a day.\\n•The collateral is fully segregated per tied asset.511\\n•Loanable securities\\nThe insurance company may only use securities for securities lending that can be easily \\nvalued on the basis of generally accessible information.512\\n•Securing the recovery\\nThe insurance company's claim to the retransfer of the borrowed assets (title) must be \\nsecured by depositing a corresponding amount of money or other assets eligible for \\ninclusion in the tied assets in favor of the insurance company (see margin nos. 524-529).513\\n•Liquidity\\nSecurities lending is only permitted if sufficient liquidity is ensured for the insurance \\ncompany.514\\n•Runtime\\nThe insurance company may reclaim the securities lent from the counterparty at any time, \\nsubject to the respective value/delivery deadlines for the delivery of the securities.515\\n\\n### Section: Page 61\\n61/70must be taken into account.

However, the swap can be settled under the \\nsame netting agreement as the other derivatives of the tied assets.\\nd) Derivatives for acquisition preparation\\naa) Permitted derivatives\\nThe derivative strategy can either provide for the acquisition of certain underlying assets at a \\nfuture date (preparation for acquisition, margin nos. 420, 421) or replace the acquisition of an \\nunderlying asset with derivatives to replicate the strategy (replicating strategy; liquidity \\ncombined with derivative, margin nos. 422-431).419\\naaa) Preparation for employment\\nThe obligation to provide liquidity cover in accordance with margin no. 5-17 must be fulfilled. 420\\nThe following instruments are permitted:\\n•Long call options\\n•Short put options421\\nbbb) Replicating strategy\\nOnly derivatives that meet the following conditions are permitted to replicate the strategy: 422\\n•The combination of derivative and liquidity has a similar market risk profile and at least the \\nsame market liquidity as the replicated investment.423\\n•The purpose of acquiring the derivative is to replicate the underlying assets. The strategy \\nmust be defined and documented internally by the insurance company. The combination \\nof derivative and liquidity is assigned to the corresponding category (e.g. the combination \\nof a money market investment and equity futures is assigned to the equities category).424\\n•The contract volume or the nominal value is 100 % covered by liquidity (margin no. 5- 17). 425\\n•The transaction through the use of derivatives does not generate any additional costs \\ncompared to the purchase of a direct investment.426\\nSpecifically, the following instruments are permitted:\\n•Long futures\\n•Long Forwards\\n•Swaps427\\n\\n### Section: Page 51\\n51/70The following instruments are specifically permitted for the purpose of replicating a corporate \\nbond or a portfolio of corporate bonds:428\\n•CDS on individual securities if the insurance company is the protection seller (sell \\nprotection)429\\n•CDS on index if the insurance company is the protection seller (sell protection) 430\\nAs an instrument of a replicating strategy, a CDS may only be allocated to tied assets if it is \\nstructured with regard to credit event payment, credit event definition and reference obligation \\nin such a way that a corporate bond or a portfolio of corporate bonds is replicated with \\nsufficient accuracy.

It must therefore be clear to which master agreement the confirmations relate.451\\nCollaterals and margin accounts that must be provided to a counterparty from tied assets in \\nconnection with the framework agreement mentioned under Art. 91 para. 3 SO do not have to \\nbe withdrawn from tied assets if they track the fluctuations of the derivative positions (variation \\nmargins), as the negative net position of the derivative transaction must already be deducted.452\\nCollateral provided to the counterparty in the form of collateral and margin accounts from the \\ntied assets is available to the counterparty without restriction as a realizable asset, provided that \\nit is used exclusively to cover obligations arising from transactions for the respective tied \\nassets that relate to the corresponding master agreement.453\\nbbb) Netting opinions\\nMaster agreements may only be concluded if legal opinions confirm that the netting \\nagreement is enforceable under the law applicable to the transaction and the netting \\nagreement. In addition\\nA framework agreement may only be concluded with a counterparty whose registered office is \\nin a454\\n\\n### Section: Page 54\\n54/70legal system for which the enforceability of netting under the relevant master agreement has \\nbeen demonstrated in a legal opinion. This also applies to Swiss counterparties, as certain \\nspecial cases are excluded in the netting opinions. For important counterparties that are not \\ncovered by a general opinion, there are sometimes additional or industry-specific opinions.\\nThe legal opinion regarding the netting agreement must confirm that the netting agreement \\n(close-out netting) is recognized and enforceable under the following laws:455\\n•according to the law of the country in which the counterparty has its registered office and \\nin which an involved branch office has its registered office;456\\n•under the law applicable to the transaction; and 457\\n•in accordance with the law applicable to the netting agreement. 458\\nThe ISDA has checked the enforceability of the framework agreements for a large number of \\ncountries by\\nConfirm legal opinions.459\\nccc) Approved Master Agreements (framework agreements, MA)\\nOnly framework agreements for which the enforceability of close-out netting can be \\ndemonstrated are permitted (see margin nos. 454-459, Netting opinions).460\\nThe most common standardized framework agreements in Switzerland are the\\n\"Swiss Master Agreement for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives\" of the Swiss Bankers \\nAssociation and the \"ISDA Master Agreements\" of the International Swaps and Derivatives \\nAssociation Inc.461\\nIn every master agreement that relates to tied assets, it must be expressly stated that the \\ncounterparty waives offsetting against claims that are not the subject of the master \\nagreement.

This is not necessary if the collateral is \\nalways provided from free assets.465\\n\\n### Section: Page 55\\n55/70cc) Provision of collateral\\nCollateral must be provided by both parties for all derivative transactions. It must be ensured \\nthat the collateral is effectively available and can be fully included in the close-out netting \\nprocess. Any third-party claims against the insurance company must not impair access to the \\ncollateral. This must also apply in the event of the insolvency of both parties.466\\nWhen concluding derivative transactions, it is permissible to provide collateral with assets \\nfrom the tied assets. This applies to both initial margin payments and variation margin \\npayments (Art. 91a para. 1 SO).467\\nCollateral may be provided in the form of a regular lien or an irregular lien under Swiss law or \\na law comparable to Swiss law, provided that the initial margin is deposited with an \\nindependent third-party custodian and is fully segregated from other assets. In this case, it \\nmust be contractually ensured that, in the event of bankruptcy of either of the contracting \\nparties, the initial margin is only used to offset outstanding claims against the insurance \\ncompany arising from derivatives transactions concluded by the latter via the central \\ncounterparty or the clearing broker (Art. 91a para. 2 SO).468\\nThe collateral received by the insurance company is pledged in the name of the insurance \\ncompany.469\\nThe custodian (the custodian bank) for the collateral received from the insurance company \\nmust comply with the guidelines on the safekeeping of assets (margin nos. 154-159) and have \\nsigned the corresponding supplementary agreement.470\\nCollateral received must comply with the investment regulations for direct investments in tied \\nassets. The collateral must be capable of being valued and traded on a daily basis and must \\nnot have been issued by the counterparty or relate to it.471\\nCollateral received may not be repledged, lent, sold or used in the context of securities lending \\nor repurchase agreements or other derivative transactions.472\\nThreshold amounts, which must be reached before any collateral has to be provided, should \\nbe kept as low as possible. Such thresholds must be set on both sides, taking into account the \\ncreditworthiness of the counterparties.473\\nMinimum transfer amounts (MTA), which must be reached before collateral must be provided \\nor reclaimed, must be kept low. If MTAs are agreed, they must always be identical for both \\nparties. Different orders of MTAs may only be provided for due to different credit ratings of the \\ncounterparties.474\\nThe collateral received is allocated to the tied assets. The counterparty has an automatic right \\nof redemption. The collateral may be taken into account when calculating the cover475\\n\\n### Section: Page 56\\n56/70of the tied assets, as the positive net value of all derivative transactions is already taken into \\naccount. The collateral must be designated in such a way that third parties can recognize that \\nit belongs to the tied assets.\\ndd) Presentation of derivative transactions\\nThe underlying is valued in accordance with the provisions of the AVO. 476\\nThe individual financial derivatives allocated to tied assets are also valued in accordance with \\nthe AVO. The individual derivative transaction is listed in the inventory of tied assets (not the \\nnet amount). If the value of a derivative contract concluded under the master agreement is \\nnegative, this negative value must be listed in the inventory of tied assets.477\\nWhen concluding a derivative transaction, the insurance company must specify the master \\nagreement to which the corresponding transaction belongs. The insurance company must \\ntake the necessary organizational measures to ensure that the derivative transactions can \\nalways be assigned to the corresponding master agreement. The inventories of tied assets \\nmay only contain the derivative transactions that are the subject of a master agreement \\nconcluded for the corresponding tied assets. The insurance company shall ensure that the \\ncounterparties are able to distinguish the derivative transactions according to their destination.478\\nK.

Repurchase agreements\\na) Definition\\nA repo (repurchase agreement) is a legal transaction in which one party (lender) transfers \\nownership of securities to another party (borrower) in return for payment and in which the \\nborrower undertakes to return securities of the same type, quantity and quality to the lender \\non maturity, as well as the income accruing during the term of the repurchase agreement. As \\nthe repurchase amount is determined in advance, the lender bears the price risk of the \\nsecurities during the term of the repurchase agreement.538\\nReverse repo (reverse repurchase agreement): Repo from the perspective of the lender. 539\\nRepo interest: Difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the securities. 540\\nWhile legal ownership of the securities in a repo transaction is transferred to the lender or \\nborrower (legal owner), the lender or borrower remains the beneficial owner. Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due in the course of the repo transaction are due to the lender. If \\ncontractually agreed, the seller may repurchase the securities sold prematurely, whereby the \\nrespective value date/delivery deadlines must be taken into account for the delivery of the \\nsecurities. As a beneficial owner, the pension provider bears the risks of fluctuations in the \\nsecurities and takes these into account when adding the securities to the tied assets.541\\nb) Purpose\\nThe repo transaction serves the purpose of obtaining short-term liquidity. Reverse repo is a \\nshort-term collateralized investment of surplus liquidity.542\\nc) Permitted transactions\\nRepurchase agreements are permitted under the following conditions: 543\\n•Framework agreement\\nThe insurance undertaking concludes the necessary framework agreements with the \\ncounterparty to the repurchase agreement (margin nos. 552-557).544\\n•Repo trading platform and settlement system\\nRepo transactions must be executed on an established repo trading platform that meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\n•central administration of the multilateral treaty system;\\n•simultaneous processing of the transaction;545\\n\\n### Section: Page 65\\n65/70•mapping of processes in real time;\\n•daily valuation (mark-to-market, at least once a day) of all open repo positions and\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The collateral should be transferred at the same time as the \\nsecurities are delivered.524\\n•The custodian (custodian bank) for the collateral must comply with the guidelines for the \\nsafekeeping of assets (margin nos. 154-159) and have signed the corresponding model \\nagreement.525\\n•The value of the collateral must be appropriate and amount to at least 105% of the market \\nvalue of the securities lent at all times. If bonds with a credit rating of 3 (or better) are lent \\nand the collateral is provided in the same currency as cash or bonds with a credit rating of \\n1, the value of the collateral must be at least 102% of the market value of the securities \\nlent.526\\n•The collateral must comply with the investment regulations for direct investments in tied \\nassets. The collateral must be capable of being valued and traded on a daily basis and \\ncorrespond to credit quality step 3 or better and must not have been issued by the \\ncounterparty or relate to it.527\\n•Collateral received may not be repledged, lent, sold or used in the context of derivative \\ntransactions, securities lending or repurchase agreements.\\nCash collateral can be reinvested in highly liquid, short-term money market investments \\nand highly liquid bonds with a (residual) term of up to a maximum of twelve months. Due \\nto the fact that the cash collateral can be recalled from the borrower at any time, the \\ninsurance company must have sufficient liquidity. Strategies and guidelines for the \\nreinvestment of cash collateral are part of the insurance company\\'s investment policy and \\nrisk management (including stress tests under various tighter market conditions) and are \\ndocumented, periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.528\\n•It must be ensured that the insurance company has full and unconditional access to the \\ncollateral if the counterparty does not return the borrowed securities, does not return them \\non time or only partially returns them.

Repurchase agreements\\na) Definition\\nA repo (repurchase agreement) is a legal transaction in which one party (lender) transfers \\nownership of securities to another party (borrower) in return for payment and in which the \\nborrower undertakes to return securities of the same type, quantity and quality to the lender \\non maturity, as well as the income accruing during the term of the repurchase agreement. As \\nthe repurchase amount is determined in advance, the lender bears the price risk of the \\nsecurities during the term of the repurchase agreement.538\\nReverse repo (reverse repurchase agreement): Repo from the perspective of the lender. 539\\nRepo interest: Difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the securities. 540\\nWhile legal ownership of the securities in a repo transaction is transferred to the lender or \\nborrower (legal owner), the lender or borrower remains the beneficial owner. Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due in the course of the repo transaction are due to the lender. If \\ncontractually agreed, the seller may repurchase the securities sold prematurely, whereby the \\nrespective value date/delivery deadlines must be taken into account for the delivery of the \\nsecurities. As a beneficial owner, the pension provider bears the risks of fluctuations in the \\nsecurities and takes these into account when adding the securities to the tied assets.541\\nb) Purpose\\nThe repo transaction serves the purpose of obtaining short-term liquidity. Reverse repo is a \\nshort-term collateralized investment of surplus liquidity.542\\nc) Permitted transactions\\nRepurchase agreements are permitted under the following conditions: 543\\n•Framework agreement\\nThe insurance undertaking concludes the necessary framework agreements with the \\ncounterparty to the repurchase agreement (margin nos. 552-557).544\\n•Repo trading platform and settlement system\\nRepo transactions must be executed on an established repo trading platform that meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\n•central administration of the multilateral treaty system;\\n•simultaneous processing of the transaction;545\\n\\n### Section: Page 65\\n65/70•mapping of processes in real time;\\n•daily valuation (mark-to-market, at least once a day) of all open repo positions and\\n•at least daily balancing of net exposures with automatic margin transfers (margin \\ncalls).\\n•Repo-able effects\\nThe insurance company may only use securities for repurchase transactions that can be \\neasily valued on the basis of generally accessible information.546\\n•Liquidity\\nRepurchase agreements are only permitted if sufficient liquidity is ensured for the insurance \\ncompany.547\\n•Runtime\\nRepurchase agreements with securities from tied assets may not exceed a term of 12 \\nmonths.548\\nd)Non-permissible transactions\\nSecurities accepted as collateral in the context of reverse repos, securities lending and similar \\ntransactions may not be used for repos.549\\nDue to the requirement that the obligation must be fully covered at all times, the underlying \\nassets of a derivative transaction must be available in the assets of the insurance company \\nand must be available without restriction. A simultaneous repurchase agreement in relation to \\nthe same underlying assets is therefore not permitted.550\\ne) Special requirements\\naa) Organization, know-how and investment process\\nInsurance undertakings that engage in repurchase transactions must have qualified and \\nknowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment \\nmanagement system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented \\ninvestment process, a suitable risk management system and an adequate system \\ninfrastructure (margin no. 76).551\\nbb) Framework agreements\\nThe standardized framework agreement between the insurance company and the \\ncounterparty must comply with the relevant international standards and regulate or comply \\nwith at least the following topics:552\\n\\n### Section: Page 66\\n66/70•The tied assets to which the master agreement relates must be specified. In addition, the \\nunderlying assets that are available for the repurchase transactions or that are excluded for \\nthe repurchase transactions must be specified. Repurchase agreements with underlying \\nassets that are held in different tied assets or in free assets are not permitted under the \\nsame framework agreement.553\\n•In deviation from margin no. 553, in the case of SIX/SIS SNB Repo, the tied assets for \\nwhich repurchase agreements can be concluded must be specified in addition to the repo \\nplatform agreement. The underlying assets available for the repo transactions must be \\ndesignated and separated for the respective tied assets. A clear and unambiguous \\nallocation of the assets associated with a repo transaction (such as cash holdings in a SIC \\naccount and transferred underlying assets for repo transactions) to the individual tied \\nassets must be ensured at all times.554\\n•The provision of collateral by the lender has been contractually agreed for each \\nrepurchase transaction and the provisions for collateral in accordance with margin nos. \\n558-563 are complied with.555\\n•The contract regulates the punctual and unrestricted remuneration of the income \\n(dividends and interest) accruing during the subscription transaction and the \\ncompensation to be paid, the assertion of other rights (e.g. conversion and subscription \\nrights) and the contractually compliant reimbursement of securities of the same type, \\nquantity and quality.556\\n•The possibility of offsetting the claims of all counterparties involved against the insurance \\ncompany with the securities lent or with the collateral must be explicitly excluded. This \\nexclusion must also be expressly declared as binding in the event of the insolvency of the \\ninsurance company.557\\ncc) Securing the reimbursement claim with collateral\\nCollateral must be delivered to a separate securities account or account of the central \\nsettlement system to secure uncovered claims from repurchase transactions. The collateral is \\nset up in the name of the insurance company. The collateral must be transferred at the same \\ntime as the securities are delivered.558\\nThe custodian for the collateral must comply with the guidelines for the safekeeping of assets \\n(margin nos. 154-159) and have signed the corresponding model agreement.559\\nThe collateral must comply with the investment regulations for direct investments in tied \\nassets. The collateral must be capable of being valued and traded on a daily basis and \\ncorrespond to credit quality step 3 or better and must not have been issued by the \\ncounterparty or relate to it.560\\nThe assets received through reverse repo may not be repledged, lent, sold or used in the \\ncontext of derivative transactions, securities lending or repo transactions.561\\n\\n### Section: Page 67\\n67/70Cash collateral can be reinvested in highly liquid, short-term money market investments and \\nhighly liquid bonds with a (residual) term of up to a maximum of twelve months. The insurance \\ncompany must have sufficient liquidity due to the fact that the cash can be recalled by the \\nlessee at any time. Strategies and guidelines for the reinvestment of cash collateral are part of \\nthe insurance company\\'s investment policy and risk management (including stress tests under \\nvarious tighter market conditions) and are documented, periodically reviewed and adjusted if \\nnecessary.562\\nIt must be ensured that the transferee has full and unconditional access to the collateral if the \\nlender is unable to repurchase the transferred securities in full, on time or only partially as \\nagreed. Any third-party claims against the insurance company must not impair access to the \\ncollateral. This must also apply in the event of the insolvency of one or more of the parties \\ninvolved.563\\nf) Limitations\\nRepo transactions and securities lending are cumulatively limited to 30% of the target amount \\nfrom a gross perspective. There is no quantitative limit for reverse repo transactions.564\\nSecurities sold through repos must be taken into account when complying with the limits in \\naccordance with margin nos. 108-122.565\\ng) Valuation, crediting and listing\\nIn order to secure reclaims from repurchase agreements, the receivables and liabilities (taking \\naccount of accrued interest) as well as the income accruing to the insurance company must \\nbe valued daily at the current market rate (mark-to-market) and the difference must be settled \\ndaily.566\\nSecurities sold through repo transactions remain allocated to tied assets. The maximum \\namount allocated is the current market value or the maximum amount allocated at the time the \\ntransaction was concluded, if this is lower.567\\nThe collateral received through reverse repo is allocated to the tied assets. However, the \\ncounterparty may repurchase the sold underlying assets at any time, subject to the notice \\nperiod. The collateral may not be taken into account when calculating the cover for the tied \\nassets.568\\nSecurities sold through repo transactions are marked as \"retired\" in the list of tied assets. \\nCollateral received through reverse repo transactions is disclosed in a separate note.569\\nThe following must be disclosed to the audit firm in an appropriate form 570\\n\\n### Section: Page 68\\n68/70•the repurchase agreements (transactions) carried out in the reporting year,\\n•the outstanding repurchase agreements, and\\n•the collateral received.\\nThe audit firm must also be provided with the necessary documentation to enable it to verify \\nongoing compliance with margin no. 562. The latter is deemed to have been complied with if it \\ncan be demonstrated that the sum of the collateral received was at no time greater than the \\namount permitted for reinvestment in accordance with margin no. 562.571\\nVI.

Chapters II and III set out FINMA's expectations with regard to the overall \\ninvestment activity of all supervised insurance companies and, in particular, the general \\nrequirements in connection with the designation of tied assets (Art. 17 of the Insurance \\nSupervision Act [ISA; SR 961.01]). Chapters IV and V explain the requirements for the \\npermissible assets in tied assets (Art. 79 of the Supervision Ordinance [SO; SR 961.011]).1\\nII General principles for total assets\\nA. Investment principles\\nWhen selecting its investments, the insurance company takes into account the structure and \\ndevelopment of the obligations (asset liability management, ALM), the security of the \\ninvestments, appropriate diversification and the insurance company's foreseeable need for \\nliquid assets.2\\nB. Derivative financial instruments\\na) Use of derivative financial instruments\\nInsurance companies may only use derivative financial instruments to reduce the risks on the \\ninvestments or on their obligations to the insured persons or to manage the investments \\nefficiently (Art. 100 SO).3\\nWhen using derivatives, the insurance company may not take any risks that are inappropriate \\nto the scope of business and risk capacity of the insurance company. The use of derivatives \\nshould also be aimed at achieving a sustainable effect.4\\nb) Obligation to provide cover when using derivatives\\nIn accordance with Art. 100 para. 2 SO, all obligations that may arise from derivative financial \\ntransactions must be covered. The obligations must be covered at all times and in full \\n(contract volume / notional value) either by the underlying assets on which the derivatives are \\nbased (in the case of derivatives with an obligation to sell) or by liquidity (in the case of \\nderivatives with an obligation to buy).5\\nLiquidity can include both cash and cash equivalents.

Securitized receivables\\na) Definition\\nSecuritized receivables are risk transfer instruments that transfer the credit risk from the \\nassets transferred to a pool of receivables to the buyers of the securitized receivable. The \\nsecuritized receivable can be divided into several tranches (senior, junior, equity tranche). The \\npool of receivables can have a uniform or mixed composition and consist of physical or \\nsynthetic (structured) receivables. Examples of securitized receivables are Asset Backed \\nSecurities (ABS), Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS, RMBS, CMBS) and Collateralized Debt \\nObligations (CDO, CBO, CLO, CMO, SFCDO).214\\nb) Permissible values\\nOnly investments in securitized receivables that can be assessed by the insurance company \\nin terms of transparency, degree of complexity, recoverability (valuation) and risk are \\npermitted.215\\nc)Non-permissible values\\nThe following values in particular are not permitted: 216\\n•Intragroup transactions with securitized receivables (margin no. 133-138). 217\\n•Investments in the high-risk tranches of a securitized receivable, i.e. in particular in the \\nequity tranche, junior tranches and mezzanine tranches. Investments in higher tranches \\n(senior tranches, super-senior tranches) are also excluded if, taking into account all \\nrelevant aspects, they do not correspond to an investment with at least credit quality step \\n4. This assessment must not be based on external credit enhancements (e.g. guarantees, \\npledges). The assessment of the underlying assets is therefore relevant. Structure-related \\ncredit enhancements (e.g. excess spread, reserve account, overcollateralization) may be \\nincluded in the analysis. The assessment process must meet the requirements of margin \\nnos. 221-224.218\\n•Investments in securitized receivables whose receivables pool is actively managed \\n(managed CDO), if this restricts the insurance company in its assessment of the risks and \\nrecoverability of the receivables pool. If the investment restrictions and the management of \\nthe receivables pool are designed in such a way that the insurance company can promptly \\ntrack changes in the composition and determine the effects on the risks and recoverability, \\ninvestments in managed CDOs are permitted.219\\n•CDOs of CDOs and similar nested structures. 220', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If \\nthird parties are involved in the analysis, any conflicts of interest must be clarified in advance. \\nThe underlying pool of receivables must be analyzed with regard to its composition and \\nrecoverability (assumptions about the distribution of default probabilities, recovery rates). In \\norder to make an assessment of the performance of a securitized receivable, it is therefore \\nnecessary to have knowledge of the markets underlying the assets in the receivables pool. It \\nmust also be taken into account whether the pool of receivables is physically present or has \\nbeen created synthetically (e.g. with the help of credit default swaps), whether the \\nsecuritization relates to cash flows or market values, whether the pool of receivables is fixed \\nor is actively restructured, etc. A close examination of the structure is essential to determine \\nthe recoverability and risk of the securitized receivable. The analysis of the structure of the \\nsecuritized receivable usually requires a breakdown into the individual stages of the \\nsecuritization.

Repurchase agreements\\na) Definition\\nA repo (repurchase agreement) is a legal transaction in which one party (lender) transfers \\nownership of securities to another party (borrower) in return for payment and in which the \\nborrower undertakes to return securities of the same type, quantity and quality to the lender \\non maturity, as well as the income accruing during the term of the repurchase agreement. As \\nthe repurchase amount is determined in advance, the lender bears the price risk of the \\nsecurities during the term of the repurchase agreement.538\\nReverse repo (reverse repurchase agreement): Repo from the perspective of the lender. 539\\nRepo interest: Difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the securities. 540\\nWhile legal ownership of the securities in a repo transaction is transferred to the lender or \\nborrower (legal owner), the lender or borrower remains the beneficial owner. Interest and \\ndividend payments falling due in the course of the repo transaction are due to the lender. If \\ncontractually agreed, the seller may repurchase the securities sold prematurely, whereby the \\nrespective value date/delivery deadlines must be taken into account for the delivery of the \\nsecurities. As a beneficial owner, the pension provider bears the risks of fluctuations in the \\nsecurities and takes these into account when adding the securities to the tied assets.541\\nb) Purpose\\nThe repo transaction serves the purpose of obtaining short-term liquidity. Reverse repo is a \\nshort-term collateralized investment of surplus liquidity.542\\nc) Permitted transactions\\nRepurchase agreements are permitted under the following conditions: 543\\n•Framework agreement\\nThe insurance undertaking concludes the necessary framework agreements with the \\ncounterparty to the repurchase agreement (margin nos. 552-557).544\\n•Repo trading platform and settlement system\\nRepo transactions must be executed on an established repo trading platform that meets the \\nfollowing requirements:\\n•central administration of the multilateral treaty system;\\n•simultaneous processing of the transaction;545', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

            "4. **Liquidity**: The insurance company must choose investments that can be realized quickly if necessary, especially in the event of the insurance company's bankruptcy.\n",

Convertible bonds, on the other hand, can be assigned to either the \"bonds\" or \"shares\" category depending on their market value relative to their nominal value. If the market value is higher than 130% of the nominal value, it can be assigned to the \"shares\" category. Convertible bonds that must be converted into shares (e.g., mandatory convertible bonds, mandatory convertible bonds, contingent convertible bonds [CoCo bonds]) are also assigned to the \"shares\" category. With regard to bonds from foreign issuers, margin no. 132 must be observed. Non-permissible values include bonds issued by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the purpose of risk transfer and securitized receivables (ABS, CDOs, etc.). Insurance-linked securities (e.g., cat bonds) are assigned to the category \"Structured products\" (margin no. 197). Bonds with a conditional debt waiver (write-off bonds) cannot be allocated to restricted assets. The evaluation of bonds and convertible bonds is done using either the scientific cost amortization method or the straight-line cost amortization method, as specified in Art. 88 para. 1 and Art. 88a AVO. The maximum imputed value is determined according to these methods plus accrued interest. Convertible bonds that fall into the category of bonds in accordance with margin no. 188 can be accounted for using the cost amortization method. Structured products, which are investments in the form of a bond or debenture in which a cash instrument is linked to one or more derivative financial instruments, are subject to specific conditions for admissibility, crediting, and valuation. These conditions include the individual components meeting the requirements of the corresponding category of tied assets, no delivery or purchase obligations, and no additional funding obligations. The structured products are valued according to one of the methods specified for bonds and convertible bonds, and the selected procedure must be maintained until the structured product is sold or redeemed.\n"

In the context of tied assets, this means investing in assets with varying credit ratings, industries, and geographical locations. The goal is to minimize the impact of potential losses in any one investment on the overall portfolio. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regulates the use of tied assets in the insurance industry, and the principle of diversification is an important consideration in their allocation. The text provided in the context information discusses the use of credit ratings as a tool for diversification within tied assets, with different credit rating levels representing varying degrees of risk and return. Additionally, the text mentions exceptions for certain types of intra-group investments, such as loans to investment companies and real estate companies, which can be counted as tied assets under certain conditions. These exceptions may also contribute to diversification by introducing different types of assets into the portfolio.\n"

            "According to the provided text, an insurance company may invest in real estate as part of its tied assets, but each individual element of the structured product and the underlyings of derivative transactions must be individually eligible. The real estate investment must meet the criteria for collective investment schemes, which include saleability at any time in a liquid market and subordination to an effective fund supervisory authority. If an investment has a non-eligible component, the entire investment is not permitted in the tied assets unless it contains additional security that compensates for the deficiency. Additionally, limits are set for individual investment categories, including real estate, and an insurance company may not hold more than a specified percentage of the target amount of each individual tied asset in real estate. Exceeding the specified limits is permitted within the scope of the excess cover of the target amount. The insurance company must take appropriate measures to ensure that the limits are complied with at all times, and securities that have been transferred to securities lending or repurchase agreements must be included in the calculation of the limits. The exposure to a counterparty may not exceed 5% of the target amount of the tied assets, but claims against the Swiss Confederation, cantons, cantonal banks with a state guarantee, and Swiss mortgage bond institutions are exempt from this limit. Receivables from debtors whose obligations are due at any time and are fully guaranteed by a state with a credit rating of 1 are also excluded from this limit. To determine the net exposure, all receivables and investment instruments in the tied assets vis-à-vis this party must be accumulated, and guarantees issued to the insurance company are also included in the calculation of net exposure. Investments in currencies other than the reference currency are limited to 20% of the target amount of the tied assets. Upon request, an insurance undertaking may deviate from these limits for the real estate investment category and apply for its own limits.\n"

They are made up of a combination of financial instruments, such as a fixed-term deposit with a variable interest rate and a receiver swap. Insurance companies use synthetic bonds to make investments with maturities that are not available on the market in the form of fixed-interest securities. The same provisions that apply to derivatives with a replicating strategy also apply to synthetic bonds. They are recognized at no more than their nominal value, separately in a sub-category of fixed-income securities, and the receiver swap is measured using the cost amortization method. If the receiver swap has a value of zero on conclusion, it must be recognized at zero for the entire term. The use of synthetic bonds is permitted with prior notification to FINMA and submission of a concept. The derivatives used to hedge cash flows from underwriting obligations are recognized at no more than the value of the cost amortization method. The replicating strategies are valued in accordance with the categories to which they are assigned. The limitations include the premiums for open derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows from technical obligations being limited to 5% of the target amount of the tied assets. The assessment involves recognizing swaptions and similar derivatives used to hedge technical obligations at no more than the value of the cost amortization method. The replicating strategies pursuant to margin nos. 406-407 and 422-431 are valued in accordance with the categories to which they are assigned.

They must also use scenario analyses to ensure that the use of complex investments does not jeopardize the value of the total assets and tied assets or the solvency of the insurance company. The insurance company is responsible for monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives, regulatory requirements, and the main risks associated with investment activities. If the insurance company commissions a third party with investment management, it remains responsible for compliance with the investment management regulations. The transfer of investment management to third parties is subject to FINMA approval. Control (risk management) must ensure and perform at least the following tasks: monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives, regulatory requirements, and the main risks associated with investment activities. For structured products or individual elements of structured products, the limitations of the categories to which they are assigned apply. The provisions relating to foreign counterparties must be taken into account, and investments in insurance-linked securities are permitted only if the resulting risks are not positively correlated with the company's own insurance risk. The insurance company must understand the investment process, monitor the specified strategy and investment principles, and be able to track all transactions in a timely manner for accounting purposes. The Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, whereby in particular the defined limits, coverage obligations, and qualitative requirements for each tied asset must be taken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization transactions, exceptions apply with regard to the limits. The insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied assets if equivalent security must be provided abroad. If no equivalent security has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the provision can be made in separate tied assets.

If claims are asserted by third parties regarding the value of the tied assets, the custodian bank must notify the custodian immediately. If the custodian wishes to book assets into custody accounts or \"tied assets\" accounts for which the custodian bank already has a security interest, the custodian bank may refuse the transfer, demand that the custodian provide substitute collateral, or demand that the collateral be redeemed.

            "The regulations ensure that the claims of the insured are prioritized in the event of an insurer's insolvency through the concept of tied assets. Tied assets are assets that are specifically allocated to secure the claims of policyholders in the event of the insurer's bankruptcy. These assets are held in trust by the insurance company on behalf of the policyholders and are intended to be used to pay out claims in the event of the insurer's insolvency. The regulations specify that the tied assets must be managed in a way that prioritizes the claims of the insured, ensuring that they are paid out before the claims of other creditors. This is achieved through the requirement that the tied assets be held in trust, which means that they are legally and financially separate from the assets of the insurance company. This ensures that in the event of the insurance company's insolvency, the tied assets are not subject to claims by other creditors and are available solely to pay out the claims of the insured. Additionally, the regulations specify that the tied assets must be diversified and liquid, ensuring that they can be readily realized to pay out claims in the event of the insurer's insolvency. This prioritization of the claims of the insured over those of other creditors is a key aspect of the regulatory framework for insurance companies, ensuring that policyholders are protected in the event of the insurer's insolvency.\n"

They are divided into convertible bonds with the character of bonds and convertible bonds with the character of shares. If the market value of a convertible bond is higher than 130% of its nominal value, it can be assigned to the \"shares\" category.

            "The principle of diversification within tied assets refers to the practice of investing in a range of different assets, each with unique risk and return characteristics, to reduce overall risk. In the context of tied assets, this means investing in assets with varying credit ratings, industries, and geographical locations. The goal is to minimize the impact of potential losses in any one investment on the overall portfolio. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regulations encourage this principle by allowing the inclusion of a wide range of assets as tied assets, provided they meet certain criteria. However, it's important to note that the specific diversification requirements, if any, would depend on the regulatory framework and the risk appetite of the insurance company.\n"

Additionally, if an investment in real estate has a non-eligible component, it may only be included in tied assets if the additional security compensates for the deficiency relating to the non-eligible part. Limits are set for individual investment categories, including real estate, and an insurance company may not hold more than a specified percentage of the target amount of each individual tied asset in real estate. Exceeding the specified limits is permitted within the scope of the excess cover of the target amount. The insurance company must take appropriate measures to ensure that the limits are complied with at all times, and securities that have been transferred to securities lending or repurchase agreements must be included in the calculation of the limits. The exposure to a counterparty may not exceed 5% of the target amount of the tied assets, but claims against the Swiss Confederation, cantons, cantonal banks with a state guarantee, and Swiss mortgage bond institutions are exempt from this limit. Receivables from debtors whose obligations are due at any time and are fully guaranteed by a state with a credit rating of 1 are also excluded from this limit. To determine the net exposure, all receivables and investment instruments in the tied assets vis-à-vis a party must be accumulated, and guarantees issued to the insurance company are also included in the calculation of net exposure. Investments in currencies other than the reference currency are limited to 20% of the target amount of the tied assets.

            "Insurance companies that invest in structured products must have qualified and knowledgeable staff, an appropriately designed investment strategy, an investment management system tailored to their specific needs, a fully implemented and documented investment process, an appropriate risk management system, and an adequate system infrastructure. The use of complex investments must be monitored to ensure that it does not jeopardize the value of the total assets and tied assets or the solvency of the insurance company. The value of the assets, compliance with regulatory requirements, and the main risks (market risk, credit risk, concentration risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, operational risk, legal risk) in connection with investment activities must be monitored and controlled. If the insurance company commissions a third party with investment management, it remains responsible for compliance with the investment management regulations. The transfer of investment management to third parties is subject to FINMA approval. Control (risk management) must ensure and perform at least the following tasks: monitoring and controlling compliance with the investment principles and objectives, monitoring and controlling compliance with regulatory requirements, and monitoring and controlling the main risks in connection with investment activities. For structured products or individual elements of structured products, the limitations of the categories to which they are assigned apply. If the structured product is broken down into eligible components, the individual components of the corresponding investment category are taken into account, with the provisions of the respective investment category observed regarding valuation and inclusion in the tied assets. If the structured product contains various embedded risks, it is assigned as a whole to the category with the highest requirements for allocation and recognition. For example, a cash instrument combined with various derivatives that participate in both equity and commodity indices are allocated as a whole to the \"alternative investments\" category. If the structured product is broken down into eligible components, the individual components of the corresponding investment category are taken into account, with the provisions of the respective investment category observed regarding valuation and inclusion in the tied assets. For example, a zero bond combined with a long call option can be split into the \"bonds\" and \"derivatives\" categories, with the zero bond valued at amortized cost and the option used at market value. The provisions relating to foreign counterparties must be taken into account. Investments in insurance-linked securities are permitted only if these investments or the resulting risks are not positively correlated with the company's own insurance risk. For structured products or individual elements of structured products, the limitations of the categories to which they are assigned in accordance with margin no. 199 apply. Separate tied assets are to be ordered for occupational pension insurance, the policyholder claims from unit-linked insurance contracts or capitalization transactions, and the policyholder claims from insurance contracts or capitalization transactions that are linked to internal investment portfolios or other reference values. The appointment of further tied assets is possible and may be ordered by FINMA in justified cases. The Circular must be observed for each separate tied asset, with the defined limits, coverage obligations, and qualitative requirements for each tied asset taken into account. For the separate tied assets of unit-linked life insurance and capitalization transactions, exceptions apply with regard to the limits. The insurance undertaking is not obliged to secure its foreign insurance portfolios with tied assets if equivalent security must be provided abroad. If no equivalent security has to be provided abroad, the security is provided in Switzerland, whereby the provision can be made in separate tied assets. If there is no equivalent guarantee abroad, a supplementary guarantee must be provided in Switzerland. The following criteria are relevant for the equivalence check: special assets.\n"

            "The text indicates that if an analogous system for offsetting the reinsured portions of the provisions exists for insurance companies that operate non-life insurance, the gross principle is deemed to be fulfilled. This means that the gross technical provisions must be covered, and only those contracts that are fully included in the target amount can participate in the special fund. Instead of special assets, other forms of security for insurance claims may be taken into account, provided their effect is certain even in the event of the bankruptcy of the insurance company and is equivalent to the effect of special assets. For these other forms, margin nos. 97 and 98 apply mutatis mutandis. This suggests that claims of non-life insurers against reinsurers are treated in a way that ensures the security and value of the investment fund, in accordance with the investment principles of security, ALM, profitability, diversification, and liquidity. However, the text does not explicitly state that these claims are included in the tied assets themselves, only that the gross technical provisions must be covered, which could be achieved through various means, including the use of other forms of security. Therefore, while the text implies that claims against reinsurers are accounted for in some way, it does not specify whether they are included in the tied assets or not.\n"
